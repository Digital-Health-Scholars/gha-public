Viewing a cross-section such as this may prove helpful in appreciating the various \\"layers\\" of the abdomen. Structures appearing bright are due to the presence of contrast material given both orally and intravenously, thus highlighting the intenstinal lumen and the intravascular space.    Abdominal Wall Questions  Radiology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Practical Quiz    Upper GI Tract  Upper GI Study  This test involves the oral ingestion of barium, a radio-opaque substance, in order to image the upper digestive tract. It is important to remember that the study highlights intraluminal anatomy (the intestinal wall is not directly visualized, only the interface between barium in the lumen and the intestinal wall)    This exam is from a different patient. The barium has moved through the duodenum and into the jejunum. Note that the differentiation of the 3rd from 4th part of the duodenum is not always clearly delineated.    CT: Axial Abdomen  This is an axial image of the upper abdomen from a CT angiogram; the scan was performed when the IV contrast was located within the arteries, before it reached the organs. Notice the pancreas and liver are dark gray, as they have not yet taken up IV contrast. The spleen is brighter, and is just starting to accumulate IV contrast.

It is done by passing an endoscope orally past the stomach and down into the duodenum where radio-opaque dye is selectively injected into the major duodenal papilla (ampulla of Vater) for fluoroscopic visualization of the biliary tree.    MRCP  Magnetic Resonance Cholangio-Pancreatography  This is a specific MRI sequence which is performed to image the biliary tract and pancreatic duct. It is a heavily T2 weighted MRI sequence where any fluid containing structure appears high signal intensity (white) on the image. The background tissues are subtracted out of the images and therefore poorly seen.    Liver Dissection   Liver Dissection (Open in New Tab)  Upper GI Questions  Radiology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Lower GI Tract  Abdominal Radiograph  This is a supine abdominal radiograph. This patient\'s small bowel is abnormally dilated, however it demonstrates the fold patterns and differentiating features of the intestines well.  Small Bowel Study  This exam was performed by administering barium and air into the small bowel, to slightly distend and opacify the bowel loops. Note the difference in fold pattern of the jejunum and ileum.    Barium Enema  This imaging study is similar to the upper GI study. It involves administration of barium rectally, which coats the colon wall, and insufflation of the colon with air to provide a \\"double contrast\\" view of the colon.    CT: Axial Lower Abdomen  This is an axial image of the mid-abdomen demonstrating the position of the various segments of the colon. The hepatic flexure contains stool, which often appears bubbly due to the air within it. The transverse and descending colon are both decompressed and therefore appear small in caliber. The small bowel is high density from the ingested oral contrast.    CT: Coronal Abdomen  These images are reformatted from an oral and IV contrast enhanced abdominal CT scan. The image on the left is the most anterior and that on the right the most posterior. These images demonstrate how the colon serves to \\"frame\\" the small bowel, which is located centrally.    Lower GI Questions  Radiology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Abdominal Angiography  AP View  This is an arteriogram of the abdominal aorta, commonly called an \\"aortogram\\". The right femoral artery was cannulated with a catheter, which was advanced into the abdominal aorta to inject contrast.    Lateral View  This is an arteriogram of the abdominal aorta, commonly called an \\"aortogram\\". The right femoral artery was cannulated and the contrast injected via a catheter placed into the abdominal aorta.    Celiac Trunk (axis) angiogram  This is a selective angiogram of the celiac trunk. Contrast has been injected through the tip of the catheter which is in the celiac trunk. Note that the bony anatomy is visible, it has not been \'subtracted\' from view. Note that the celiac trunk is at the L1 vertebral body level.    Renal CT Angiogram  This thick axial image is part of a CT angiogram, where contrast dye is injected into a peripheral vein for optimal imaging of the vasculature. This image was taken when the contrast material was in greatest concentration in the arterial system, making the arteries bright.    Superior Mesenteric Angiogram  This is a selective angiogram of the superior mesenteric artery. Note that the tip of the catheter is in the proximal SMA. Some of the injected contrast refluxes back into the aorta. Note that the bony anatomy has been \'subtracted\' from view by a computer program in order to focus on the vascular anatomy.    This is the same image unsubtracted (i.e. with bones).    Portal Venogram  This angiogram of the portal vein was obtained during a special procedure known as a TIPS procedure (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) which is performed for relief of portal hypertension. A catheter (white line descending from the middle portion of the top of the image) has been placed from the right internal jugular vein, through the superior vena cava, through the right atrium and out the right hepatic vein. The catheter then travels through the liver parenchyma and into the right branch of the portal vein. The tip of the catheter is in the splenic vein. Contrast was injected through this catheter to obtain this image.    Inferior Mesenteric Angiogram  This is a selective angiogram of the inferior mesenteric artery. The contrast is filling the inferior mesenteric artery and its branches. Note that the bony anatomy has been \'subtracted\' from view by a computer program in order to focus on the vascular anatomy.    This is same image unsubtracted (i.e. with bones).Note that in the unsubtracted image, the contrast that has been excreted into the renal collecting systems is visible.

They are used to assess alignment of the spine, and to look for ligamentous instability (ligament tears or laxity may result in vertebral bodies slipping forward or backward on each other).    Note that the vertebral bodies remain aligned normally with movement, as is shown by the smooth, continuous posterior spinal line. Note the uniform widening of the interspinous spaces with flexion.    Vertebral Bodies   Note the numbering of the vertebral bodies on this AP radiograph of the cervical spine. See if you can identify the indicated structures in the following image.    Odontoid View  This image is taken in an AP projection with the patient\'s mouth open.    C1/C2 Level    CT: Mid Cervical Spine - axial image through vertebral body  This image is taken through the mid-portion of a vertebral body in the cervical spine.    CT: Mid Cervical Spine - axial image through intervertebral disk  This image is at the level of the intervertebral disc. As a result some of the bony structures are from the level above, and some from the level below the disc.    Sagittal and coronal views  The following two images are reformatted from a helical CT scan of the cervical spine. They are supplementary to axial images and are useful for evaluating alignment and joint spaces. Some fractures, such as compression fractures, are easier to identify on these images, as the loss of height is easier to appreciate.      Thoracic Spine  These radiographs are for evaluation of the thoracic spine. Although there is detail in the chest cavity, that will be the focus of subsequent sessions. At this time, use these images to evaluate spinal anatomy and associated structures. At times it can be challenging to locate a particular vertebral level. \\"Counting ribs\\" on radiographs is a skill that improves with practice. For these two images it is best to locate the T12 vertebra (most inferior vertebra articulating with a rib) and count from that location.      Axial MRI  By convention, axial or \\"cross-sectional\\" images are oriented such that the patient is lying supine and you are viewing from the feet. As you have seen in prior T2-weighted images, CSF/fat are bright and ligamentous structures are dark. Soft tissue structures are varying shades of gray. This image is from the lower thoracic region.    Lumbar Spine  These are common radiograph views of the lumbar spine. Note that the bony prominences of the spine are \\"flattened\\" (superimposed) in the AP projection. The junction between the thoracic spine and lumbar spine is seen by identifying the 12th ribs.      T1-weighted Sagittal MRI  This is a T1-weighted MRI image.

The internal anatomy of the heart is not visible on radiography.  Chest Radiographs are the best exam to assess for heart failure; specifically for pulmonary edema.  Computed Tomography (CT)  The cardiac chambers, muscles, coronary arteries, large vessels and the pericardium are easily visualized on standard CT scans performed with iv contrast. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a technique in which the CT is performed during a specific early time point after iv contrast administration, when the arteries are brightly enhanced with contrast, but not enough time has passed to allow the contrast to flow through the capillaries and into the veins. CTA is an excellent method to evaluate the coronary arteries, given its high spatial resolution.  CTA datasets can be reconstructed to show the origin and course of the coronary arteries (as well as other, larger arteries) and 3D images of the vessels can be created to show their course and caliber. Since the heart is beating while the CT data is acquired, imaging is performed during both systole and diastole. The CT data can be sampled at specific time points in the cardiac cycle, which enables viewing of the myocardium, papillary muscles and valves during systole and/or diastole, and enables calculation of the left ventricular ejection fraction.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved rapidly. MR images are generated based on the magnetic properties of hydrogen ions and basically detect differences in magnetic behavior between hydrogen ions bound in various molecular environments. An MRI examination is made up of multiple imaging series of the heart, each one slightly different. These series are called pulse sequences (which is a standardized way of obtaining an image).  Cardiac MRI/MRA has evolved to become an important tool in the assessment of the heart, and has specific uses in clinical care. You will learn more about this during your clinical rotations & further discussion is beyond the intent of this course.  Angiography  Angiography is a minimally invasive procedure with inherent risks, including arterial trauma and embolization, that although rare, may have serious consequences. Non-coronary angiography is performed by Interventional Radiologists, as well as by other specialties. Coronary Angiography is performed by Interventional Cardiologists, and will be addressed in this course during the cardiology sessions.  Vasculature Imaging Modalities  Radiography  Several blood vessels in the mediastinum are bordered by the lungs, with the contrast of their densities rendering their edges visible. So the edges of the superior vena cava and descending aorta are visible on a radiograph. However, the caliber and luminal patency of the vessels are not visible. Most blood vessels are not conspicuous on radiographs.  Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA)  Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a technique in which the CT is performed during a specific time point after iv contrast administration, when the arteries are brightly enhanced with contrast, but not enough time has passed to allow the contrast to flow through the capillaries and into the veins. CTA is an excellent method to evaluate the vasculature given its high spatial resolution. CTA can be timed to evaluate either the arteries, veins, or both.  CTA datasets can be reconstructed to show the origin and course of arteries throughout the body, and 3D images of the vessels can be created to show their overall size and interrelationships. CTA is widely used to look for aneurysms, to assess for vascular narrowing (stenosis) or occlusion, and to look for acute pathology, like aortic dissection. One major benefit of CTA over angiography is that it demonstrates the arterial lumen, arterial wall and adjacent tissues. Conventional angiography shows ONLY the lumen.  Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)  Magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative method used to evaluate the major arteries and veins, with minimal risk to the patient, and no radiation exposure. It is more expensive and time consuming than CTA or conventional angiography, however it effectively shows the lumen of the large and medium size blood vessels, and is predominantly used to determine vascular patency. Since MRI has lower spatial resolution than CT, it is not as useful for small vessels.  Conventional Angiography  Angiography is a minimally invasive procedure with inherent risks, including arterial trauma and embolization that although rare, may have serious consequences. Angiograms are basically X-ray images of the blood vessels after contrast has been injected directly into them via an intravascular catheter. The contrast opacifies the vessel lumen, rendering it radiodense. It’s important to understand that the images show only the lumen of the blood vessel; the walls and surrounding tissues are not depicted.  Because angiography is invasive, it is no longer considered a first line method of vascular assessment. Instead, it is now used primarily for therapeutic purposes, such as opening occluded or narrowed blood vessels, stopping bleeding, and treating other acute conditions.  Ultrasound  Ultrasound is a relatively low cost and low risk means of evaluating the heart (called echocardiography- performed by cardiologists) and blood vessels, and is used extensively in the carotid arteries. Doppler ultrasound informs about the overall caliber of a vessel, provides information about the vessel wall and lumen. It effectively demonstrates stenosis (narrowing). Spectral doppler is used to measure flow velocity to help determine if an area of narrowing is significantly limiting blood flow.  Heart Structures  PA Chest Radiograph  The size of the heart and the borders of certain chambers can be evaluated on a PA chest film. By performing the film PA, the heart is placed close to the detector plate, preventing magnification of the heart.    Cardiomegaly  This is a comparison of a normal-sized heart (right image) with an enlarged heart (left image). Notice that the enlarged heart is more globular in shape. The left heart borders is closer to the left lateral chest wall, and the right heart border extends out farther from the spine compared to the normal heart.  cardiomegaly  Lateral Chest Radiograph  In this view, the anterior and posterior heart borders are visible. There is some superimposition of the heart chambers on this view. The most posterior chamber is the left atrium, and the most anterior chamber is the right ventricle.    CT Heart  This is an axial CT image of the heart. Below are a reference PA chest radiograph and a comparable anatomic image from the Visible man showing the approximate level of this axial slice. As in all axial (transverse) images, the patient is lying supine and you are observing from the patient\'s feet looking towards the head.  An iodine based CT contrast agent was injected intravenously to opacify (increase the density of) the heart chambers and blood vessels.      Coronal CT  This image is of the same patient as in the previous image. CT images are obtained as a helix of data that can then be reformatted into imaging planes. This is a coronal reformated image of the contrast enhanced chest CT.    Cardiac Chambers  The borders of each cardiac chamber are not discernable on radiography (except where they are border forming with the lung, like the lateral margin of the right atrium). This demonstrates the approximate position of the chambers and large vessels.    Cardiac Chambers on Radiography (Lateral)  This demonstrates the approximate position of the chambers and large vessels on the lateral radiograph.    Mediastinum  PA Chest Radiograph  Many of the mediastinal structures are of similar density, so it is difficult to differentiate them with radiography. However, structures that are adjacent to the radiolucent lungs (less dense) can be visualized due to the difference in density.    CT: Axial Superior Mediastinum  This is a series of axial (transverse) CT images of the thorax of one patient. The images have been \\"windowed\\" (contrast adjusted) in order to highlight soft-tissue structures, and consequently, the lungs appear mostly black. As you work through these images, it may be helpful to remember the structures in the previous \\"slice\\" in order to be able to trace those structures and maintain orientation. This first image will ask you to name several structures for reference, most of which will continue to be present in subsequent slices. In all of these images, vascular structures are bright due to the injection of contrast dye in the venous system (usually via the arm) of the patient. You can assume that black represents air.  The reference chest radiographs show the approximate level of the axial slice.  Slices  Each of the following CT slices is more caudal than the slice prior.          Vasculature  Aortic Arch Angiogram  An aortic arch angiogram is obtained by threading a catheter into the ascending aorta and injecting iodine-based dye. Sequential X-rays are then taken as the dye is injected. This image is a static image from the angiogram series.    Left Coronoary Angiogram    An angiogram of the coronary arteries is performed by threading a small catheter from the femoral artery in the groin up into the aorta, and selectively cannulating the coronary ostia. Radio-opaque dye is then injected and X-ray images are obtained via fluoroscopy to evaluate the coronary anatomy. Fluoroscopy allows for real-time acquisition of images, and is a technique which is conceptually similar to the standard X-ray radiographs which you have seen thus far. A major difference is that radio-dense material appears dark rather than bright. This image of the left coronary system is obtained via a right anterior oblique view of the heart.    Right Coronary Angiogram  This image was obtained via a left anterior oblique view (almost as thought you were looking \\"down the barrel\\" of the heart) in order to view the right coronary artery as it courses along the outside of the atrioventricular groove on the right. Because of the angle, the posterior interventricular artery branch will look significantly foreshortened.    Left Ventriculogram  This image is obtained by threading the catheter into the left ventricle and injecting contrast dye. The dynamic ejection of blood into the aorta can then be evaluated.

They are very commonly used in the practice of clinical medicine. This module will serve as an introduction to CT, and provide you with information that will help you to understand what you are looking at when you view an image.  How Images Are Obtained  CT images use x- rays to obtain a thin axial image of the patient- a “slice”.  To obtain CT images, the beam of x-rays and the x-ray detector circle around the patient, continuously producing and detecting a thin beam of x-rays that pass through the patient. This is in contrast to radiographs, where a stationary x-ray beam source and detector are used.  The CT Scanner  The patient lies on a table that slowly moves through a circular tube, called the gantry. The gantry houses the generator that produces the x-rays as well as a specialized x-ray detector. The two are located 180 degrees apart from one another. The generator and detector move in unison around the patient, continuously transmitting a thin beam of x-rays through the patient. Those that are not absorbed by the patient are sensed by the detector and transmitted to a computer. The data is analyzed and an image produced which represents one \\"slice\\" of the patient.  Traditionally, with each 360 degree rotation of the x-ray beam and detector, data is obtained from that axial section of the patient.  The table then moves, and another axial section of the patient is obtained.  With newer CT scanners, the table moves continuously through the gantry, and the generator and detector continuously circle the patient.  As a result, instead of a single “slice” of the patient being obtained with each rotation, a continuous helix of data is obtained.  A specialized computer interprets the information from the detector and transforms it into images, which represent sequential “slices” of the patient.  CT-scanner  Viewing the Image  Images are viewed as though the patient is lying down on his/her back and you are standing at the foot of the patient looking towards their head. The patient\'s right side is displayed on the left of the image, and the left side on the right. Images are generally displayed in the order they are obtained, from superior to inferior. In this way, structures can be followed from image to image. If you aren\'t sure which structure you are looking at, try looking at the slice above or the slice below to help follow the structure and determine its origin.  Below are two sequential CT images of the upper abdomen; the image on the left is 5mm superior to the image on the right. Each of these images represents a slice of the patient which is 5 mm thick.  The superior image is taken through the superior aspect of the pancreas (\\"P\\") and not much of the organ is visible on this slice. This makes it difficult to identify. Looking at the image just below will help, as more of the pancreas is now visible allowing appropriate identification of the structure. Note the right kidney is not visible on the superior image. The second, more inferior image shows the most superior part of the kidney, \\"K\\".    Factors Affecting the Appearance  CT images are produced with ionizing radiation, similar to radiographs. Therefore, some of the factors affecting the appearance of the CT images are similar to radiography (for example density).  On CT, the density of a structure, the image display, and the use of iv contrast enhancement are the main factors affecting the appearance of structures. Shape and thickness do not affect the final CT image as much as they do in radiographs, since CT images are summations of only thin slices of superimposed structures.  The data obtained can be displayed (or \\"windowed\\") to highlight certain structures. The two chest CT images shown are from the same set of data at the same level. The left image is displayed in \\"lung\\" windows and the right in \\"soft tissue\\" windows. Note that lung windows show the lung parenchyma (small blood vessels, bronchi, and airspaces), but one is unable to distinguish the soft tissue structures well. Soft tissue windows show the muscles, fat and blood vessels well, but not the lung parenchyma.    Density  Since x-rays are used to obtain CT images, the density of a structure affects the final image of a CT in a similar manner.  Dense structures, like bone, attenuate more of the x-ray beam and appear white.  Less dense structures, like air, attenuate less of the x-ray beam and appear black.  Soft tissue structures are of intermediate densities and appear as varying shades of gray.  The CT detectors are much more sensitive than conventional radiograph cassettes.  With the detector and beam rotation allowing for the accumulation of many data points in one slice, spatial resolution is excellent, and subtle differences in soft tissue densities are visible which are not noted on routine x-ray.    On CT, soft tissue structures appear as varying shades of gray, depending on the density of the structure. Structures of similar density are easier to differentiate from each other on CT than on radiography.  Note that the fluid filled gallbladder can be differentiated from the adjacent liver, which is higher in density and appears a lighter shade of gray.  The spleen and left kidney can be seen distinctly from each other, partially due to the excellent spatial resolution of CT, but also due to differences in density.      Similar to radiographs, when structures of differing densities are next to one another, they can be distinguished from each other.  Note that the low density fat between the right kidney and liver helps to differentiate them. In contrast, it is not possible to see the border between the duodenum and pancreas, since they are of similar densities and there is no intervening tissue of a different density present to help distinguish them from each other.  Contrast Enhancement  In order to discretely identify tissues that are immediately adjacent to one another on CT, their densities must be different enough so that they appear as varying shades of gray on the CT image.  To aid in the differentiation of structures seen on CT, particularly if they are of similar density, intravenous contrast dye (x-ray dye) is often used. The dye is composed of iodine which is quite dense and therefore attenuates x-rays, thus appearing white on CT. The dye is administered to the patient by intravenous injection. When this is done, tissues in the body will take up the contrast and appear a lighter shade of gray than they would without the dye. The more dye that a tissue takes up, the lighter shade of gray it appears on CT; the more it is said to \\"enhance\\".  Look at the two images below.  The image on the left is \\"unenhanced\\" (no x-ray dye was given). Note that the kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen and blood vessels all appear nearly the same shade of gray. The image on the right is \\"enhanced\\" (obtained after intravenous contrast was administered). Note that each organ is a lighter shade of gray than on the unenhanced image, and each now differs from each other in its subtle shade of gray. This results from differences in the amount of x-ray dye that each organ absorbs; the more absorbed, the lighter the shade of gray. The kidneys absorb the most dye and so appear the lightest. Also note that you can see blood vessels in the liver, since they contain a higher concentration of the dye than the adjacent liver parenchyma. Also note the splenic vein, which sits immediately posterior to the pancreas, is now seen discretely apart from it.    What Anatomical Structures Are Well Seen  CT can display differences between soft tissues that differ in physical density by as little as 1%. Most anatomic structures are visualized on CT scans, including bone, air, fluid, fat, and soft tissues.  All of these structures are better demonstrated on CT than on radiography. This results from a combination of factors, including the very sensitive CT detectors that differentiate smaller differences in densities, the excellent spatial resolution CT affords, and the fact that the images are single \\"slices\\" of the body (while radiographs represent a superimposition of a number of structures).  Abdominal Structures  Compare these images of the abdomen. The image on the left is a radiograph and the right is a CT image of the mid-abdomen. The radiograph shows the bones well, and air within the bowel, however airless bowel, the individual organs, blood vessels, lymph nodes and other soft tissue structures cannot be seen. In contrast, the CT shows the individual organs, the bowel that contains air as well as the bowel which is airless (fluid filled), blood vessels and all of the fat intervening between and around these structures.    Thorax  Structures in the chest are also well seen with CT, including bones, blood vessels, lungs, trachea, esophagus, fat, as well as the muscles of the body wall.  Compare what soft tissues structures look like on the chest radiograph on the left and the chest CT image on the right. The trachea is seen on the radiograph, since it is air filled and more lucent than the adjacent structures of the mediastinum. Note that the esophagus, blood vessels and muscles cannot be differentiated on the radiograph, but they are easily seen on the CT.    Brain  CT is also an excellent way to view the brain and contents within the skull. None of these can be seen with radiographs.  The image on the left is of the inferior part of the brain, and the image on the right is slightly more superior. Note the low density fluid of the subarachnoid space and lateral ventricles is well differentiated from the varying shades of gray of the arteries supplying the brain, and the brain parenchyma itself. CT also demonstrates the subtle differences in the gray and white matter tracts of the brain parenchyma, which have different compositions and functions. The white matter appears darker than the gray matter.    Indications For Use  CT is widely used to help diagnose a variety of different problems and symptoms. It is excellent for evaluating lung parenchyma, as well as soft tissues of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis. It is also a quick and relatively inexpensive way to evaluate the brain.  CT can be used as a primary imaging tool to evaluate a patient\'s symptoms, or can provide additional information when other tests are inconclusive. CT is currently widely available and easily accessible.  It is beyond the intentions of this submodule to discuss all of the potential uses of CT, but this should serve as a broad guideline to help one understand the general uses of CT.  Chest  CT is widely used to evaluate structures in the thorax. Tumors of the lung or chest wall, infections, emphysema and other chronic lung diseases are well demonstrated on CT.  More recently, CT has become a more powerful way to evaluate the blood vessels in the thorax and the heart. This includes evaluation for blood clots in the pulmonary arteries, atherosclerosis and narrowing in the coronary arteries and aorta, abnormal dilatations of blood vessels (aneurysms), and cardiac function.  Below is a chest CT image displayed in lung windows. Note how well the lung parenchyma is seen; the individual blood vessels and airspaces are visible. Also note that the soft tissues of the chest wall and mediastinum are not seen adequately. When viewing a CT, it is important that the display is set appropriately to allow visualization of the structures of interest. Do you see the mass in the lung?  indic-lung-mass1  Below are identical images displayed in different windows. The image on the left is in soft tissue windows and that on the right in lung windows. Both images show the tumor mass in the medial right lung.    Note that the tumor extension into the mediastinum, adjacent to the aorta and trachea is only appreciated on the soft tissue windows. This is not well seen on the lung windows and was not visible on the patient\'s chest radiograph shown below.  indic-lung-mass  Bone  As discussed earlier in this learning module, radiography is an excellent modality to evaluate the bones. There are instances in which CT is indicated for further evaluation or problem solving. This occurs most commonly in complex intra-articular fractures of the hip, ankle, and knee. CT is also used to evaluate tumor infiltration into bone.  Note in the radiograph of the knee on the left, the fracture of the proximal tibia is easily seen (arrows). The CT image on the right is a coronal reformat of a CT of the knee. Note that the complexity of the fracture is shown with greater detail on the CT image. It is easier to see that there are multiple fracture lines and that the fracture lines extend through the epiphysis into the knee joint space. This information impacts how this fracture is treated.    Abdomen  There are extensive uses for CT of the abdomen. These include a) abdominal pain, b) inflammatory conditions such as suspected appendicitis or diverticulitis, c) tumor assessment, d) enlargement of organs, e) kidneys stones, and f) obstruction of the bowel, kidneys or bile ducts.  The CTs images below are from two different patients who presented to the ER with abdominal pain. The left image demonstrates a dilated right renal collecting system (the calyces and renal pelvis) due to obstruction of the right ureter. This is commonly caused by a renal stone lodging within the ureter and obstructing the drainage of the kidney. The right image demonstrates acute appendicitis. The appendix is abnormally dilated, with swelling in the wall and inflammation around it.    New Technology  Faster CT scanners that can acquire thinner sections, and advances in computer software have significantly impacted the field of CT. Reformations into any imaging plane are now commonly performed. This augments visualization of anatomy and aids in diagnosis.  Coronal Reformats  Below are coronal reformats of an abdomen CT. The image on the left shows the relationship of the heart to the diaphragm and liver, and the course of the small and large bowel and mesenteric blood vessels.  The image on the right shows the relationship of the kidneys to the adrenal glands, and demonstrates that the kidneys are located quite posteriorly in the abdomen; as posterior as the spine, since they are both seen in this same coronal section.    3D Volume Rendering  This is a way of reformatting CT image data to produce a 3 dimensional image of selected structures, excluding the structures which are not of interest. The images can be rotated in any orientation to see the anatomy from any perspective. 3D volume rendered images are most useful in preoperative planning for complex vascular procedures or complex fractures, such as those of the pelvis or proximal tibia. A 3D volume rendered image from an abdominal CT angiogram is shown. Note that the arteries and their branching pattern is displayed. The kidneys and spine are visible, but most other soft tissue structures are not demonstrated with this technique.  new-tech-VR2  CT Angiography (CTA) is a CT technique targeted to display the arteries. Traditionally, in order to see the blood vessels with this level of detail, patients would have to undergo an angiogram, which is an invasive procedure in which catheters are placed directly into the arteries and contrast injected directly into the blood vessel.    The image on the right is another example of a 3D volume rendered image from a CT angiogram of the brain. This shows the arteries supplying the brain. The tissue seen in the background is the base of the skull. Traditionally, in order to see the blood vessels to this level of detail, patients would have to undergo an angiogram, which is an invasive procedure in which catheters are placed directly into the carotid or vertebral arteries with direct intraarterial contrast injection.  This is a 3 dimensional volume rendered image of the blood vessels forming the circle of willis at the base of the brain.

Fluoroscopic images look just like x-ray images, as they are obtained with a similar technique.  The benefit of fluoroscopy is the ability to visualize dynamic processes as they are occurring; think of fluoroscopy as a live x-ray movie. The downside of fluoroscopy, which is important to keep in mind, is the relatively high radiation dose to the patient.  Angiography is the use of fluoroscopy to place catheters and other interventional devices into blood vessels and image blood flow in vessels.  How Images Are Obtained  Fluoroscopy Unit  The patient lies on a specialized table between the x-ray generator and the detector. The generator produces an x-ray beam which travels through the patient towards a specialized detector called the image intensifier.    The image intensifier absorbs the transmitted x-rays and emits part of the absorbed energy as light photons. Through a sophisticated process, the number of light photons emitted is amplified and they are converted into a digital image. This is then displayed live on a tv monitor.  The physician observes the images on the monitor live, as the study is being performed.  Angiography  Angiography is a general term describing the imaging of blood vessels with x-ray dye. Arteriograms refer to imaging of arteries, while venograms refer to imaging of veins.  Angiograms are obtained by injecting radioopaque contrast material (x-ray dye-just like that used in CT) into a blood vessel. The contrast mixes with the blood in the vessel, and is propelled forward by cardiac action (arteriograms) or towards the heart with venous return (venograms). The flow of the blood/contrast mixture can be observed fluoroscopically, or a sequence of static x-ray images can be obtained.    Fluoroscopy is used to guide the placement and the positioning of the catheter into the blood vessel which is being studied.  The movie on the right is an arteriogram of the lower extremities. The catheter enters the right common femoral artery (catheter appears as a faint black line going across the right femur). The tip of the catheter is in the aorta, and this is where the contrast has been injected.  It is important to understand these concepts when looking at angiograms:  It is the vessel lumen that is being opacified - the vessel wall is not seen.  The images can be displayed with the opacified blood vessels appearing white or black.  You must look at the entire sequence of films, not just one film, in order to interpret angiograms optimally.  The degree of radioopacity produced by a contrast injection will depend on the relative proportions of blood and contrast. As more (unopacified) blood mixes in with the contrast bolus, the vessel lumen will become fainter.  If the heart is not pumping forcefully, and/or if the flow of blood is slow through a region (e.g. the main artery supplying the region is obstructed), the bolus of contrast will move comparatively slowly through the arterial tree.  Factors Affecting the Appearance  As fluoroscopy images are live images using x-rays, the same factors which affect the appearance of radiographs will influence the fluoroscopic image, such as density, thickness and shape. Click here if you need to review these factors. The main difference in the appearance of radiographs vs. fluoroscopic images is in the use of contrast. Contrast agents are almost always used to highlight areas of interest and improve the diagnostic yield of the study.  Contrast agents can be placed in many different cavities of the body to allow them to be seen, including blood vessels, GI tract, biliary system, CNS, joints, uterus, and the urinary tract. What contrast agent is used will affect the appearance as well.  Display  Importantly, fluoroscopic images are digital images which can be displayed such that dense structures appear white, like radiographs, or the images can be inverted such that dense structures appear black.  Intraluminal Contrast Agent: Barium  The first image shows barium which has been swallowed and is traveling down the esophagus into the stomach. Barium is very dense, absorbing much of the incident x-ray beam and so appears white on the film. Without the barium, the stomach and esophagus wouldn\'t be visible on an x-ray. Barium coats the mucosa and fills the lumen. Note the lungs appear dark and the ribs white, just like on an X-ray.  The second image is from a barium enema. Through a rectal catheter, barium is instilled into the rectum and flows retrograde into the colon. Its movement is observed fluoroscopically to ensure that the entire colon is coated and evaluated. Air is also instilled into the colon to distend it so that all of the walls are seen. This is called a \\"double contrast barium enema\\". In this image, the patient has been rolled so that they are lying on their right side. (Note the air-barium level, with the barium located dependently). The flow of barium is observed fluoroscopically as the patient is moved. Barium coats the mucosa of the colon to make it visible on x-rays.  Intraarterial and Intravenous Contrast  Angiograms (arteriograms and venograms) are obtained by injecting radioopaque contrast directly into a blood vessel via a needle or catheter. The contrast is iodine, which mixes with the blood and attenuates the x-ray beam, making the lumen of the blood vessel high density. The iodine is subsequently filtered through the kidneys and excreted in the urine.  The forward movement of the contrast bolus that occurs concurrent with venous return (venogram) or arterial flow (arteriogram) is observed fluoroscopically. Without the injected x-ray dye, the blood vessels would not be visible.  Angiograms are displayed digitally, and can be manipulated to show the vessel lumen as white or black. The movie below, of an abdominal aortic angiogram, is \\"subtracted\\" which means that the bones and other radiodense structures have been subtracted from the image so that only the opacified blood vessels are visible.    Intraarticular Contrast Agent: Iodine  Arthrography  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a needle can be placed into a joint, and iodinated contrast can be injected while watching fluoroscopically to better define and outline a joint space or bursa. This is called arthrography. Without the contrast, the joint space or bursa is not visible.  After the joint has been injected, it is put through its range of motion to allow for complete filling of the joint space, as well as to assess the capsule, look for fragments or loose bodies in the joint space, and assess the cartilage and underlying bone.  Images from a left shoulder arthrogram are displayed. Dense structures, like bone, appear dark. The injected contrast is dark. Note the size of the joint space, and how far inferiorly it extends. The lower image shows the thickness of the articular cartilage. The white arrows indicate contrast in the joint space and the lucency between this contrast and the bone is the articular cartilage.    Indications for Use  Fluoroscopy is used to evaluate dynamic processes and structures in motion. It is used both in the diagnosis and in the treatment of disease. Diagnostic uses include evaluation of swallowing function, study of the gastrointestinal tract, motion of the diaphragm and motion of joints, evaluation of blood vessel patency and size. Therapeutically, it is used in everyday practice as guidance for a wide variety of interventional procedures, performed by radiologists and other specialists.  Gastrointestinal Tract    Fluoroscopy is invaluable in the evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested barium is watched fluoroscopically as it moves throughout the gastrointestinal structures. Things that can be observed fluoroscopically include swallowing function, motility and peristalsis of the esophagus, stomach, small and large bowel, and the rapidity of transit throughout these gastrointestinal structures. The fold pattern, distensibility, and caliber of these structures is also observed.  Clinically, fluoroscopy of the GI tract allows diagnosis of obstructions, strictures, abnormal peristalsis, bowel wall edema, and impaired swallowing function such as aspiration into the trachea. The image on the left is an x-ray taken during ingestion of barium under fluoroscopic guidance. Note how well the fold pattern of the small bowel loops is seen, outlined with barium.  Joint Motion  Joint motion can be observed fluoroscopically. This allows assessment of the range of motion of a joint, and will display any limitations of motion. Joint subluxations can sometimes be detected by having the patient perform certain maneuvers.  The movie on the right demonstrates the range of motion of the radiocarpal joint as seen fluoroscopically.    Arteriography and Arterial Interventions  Arteriography is performed to look for areas of narrowing (stenosis), occlusions, aneurysms, traumatic injuries, blood clots, and anomalies of blood vessels.  In order to perform arteriography, a catheter has to be placed into the blood vessel of interest and iodinated contrast is injected through the catheter. Fluoroscopy is used to guide placement of the catheter in the blood vessel as well as to observe the flowing blood and contrast.    Stenosis of blood vessels can also be treated using fluoroscopy to guide in the balloon dilatation of an area of narrowing, or in the placement of a stent, as shown in the images on the right from a lower extremity arteriogram. The arrow in the first image indicates a stenosis of the superficial femoral artery. This prevents adequate blood flow from getting to the more distal leg, causing symptoms of pain. Under fluoroscopic visualization, a wire was advanced down the artery, through the area of narrowing, and over the wire a metal stent was opened in the artery, stretching the area of narrowing. The white arrows in the second arteriogram image show the superior and inferior edges of the stent which was placed across the stenosis. Note the lumen appears widely patent after the stent was placed. The black arrow is pointing to a fine wire in the artery. Interventions have to be performed over a wire, which acts as a conduit over which to deliver the catheters, stents, or balloons.  Venography  Venograms are used primarily to determine the patency of veins, to look for blood clots, and to look for areas of narrowing.  The movie on the right is a venogram of the left arm and chest. The contrast has been injected through a small catheter which had been placed into the left antecubital vein. The contrast, mixed with blood, is seen flowing through the left brachial, axillary, subclavian and brachiocephalic veins and into the superior vena cava. The left cephalic vein is also faintly seen.    Guidance for Interventional Procedures  Fluoroscopy provides real time guidance when performing procedures. The target tissue is visualized, and a needle, catheter or wire can be advanced at that target under direct visualization. This increases the accuracy, and decreases the potential complications of procedures.  Example: Percutaneous drainage of an obstructed renal collecting system  The images above demonstrate a fluoroscopically guided percutaneous nephroureteral stent placement. In the first image, a needle has been advanced into the renal collecting system and contrast injected. In the second image, a wire has been placed through the needle and coiled in the collecting system. In the third image, a tube has been placed over the wire into the lower collecting system and extends down the ureter. The tube carries urine from the renal collecting system to the bladder, bypassing a ureteral obstruction. All of these maneuvers are performed while watching with fluoroscopy.  Example: Fluoroscopically guided fallopian tube recannalization  Blocked fallopian tubes is one cause of infertility. The tubes can be opened up again or \\"recannalized\\" through a relatively minor intervention. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a catheter is placed through the cervix into the lower uterus and contrast is injected. The top image on the right shows that the injected contrast fills the uterine cavity and left fallopian tube. The right fallopian tube is not seen and is occluded.  While watching fluoroscopically, a tiny flexible wire and catheter are passed through the occlusion in the right fallopian tube, thus recannalizing it and increasing the patient\'s chances of conceiving. This is shown in the bottom image.  \xa0 "},{"data":{"title":"Gastrointestinal Imaging","excerpt":"Anatomy and imaging of the GI tract.

It is done by passing an endoscope orally past the stomach and down into the duodenum where radio-opaque dye is selectively injected into the major duodenal papilla (ampulla of Vater) for fluoroscopic visualization of the biliary tree.    MRCP  Magnetic Resonance Cholangio-Pancreatography  This is a specific MRI sequence which is performed to image the biliary tract and pancreatic duct. It is a heavily T2 weighted MRI sequence where any fluid containing structure appears high signal intensity (white) on the image. The background tissues are subtracted out of the images and therefore poorly seen.    Liver Dissection   Liver Dissection (Open in New Tab)  Upper GI Questions  Radiology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Lower GI Tract  Abdominal Radiograph  This is a supine abdominal radiograph. This patient\'s small bowel is abnormally dilated, however it demonstrates the fold patterns and differentiating features of the intestines well.  Small Bowel Study  This exam was performed by administering barium and air into the small bowel, to slightly distend and opacify the bowel loops. Note the difference in fold pattern of the jejunum and ileum.    Barium Enema  This imaging study is similar to the upper GI study. It involves administration of barium rectally, which coats the colon wall, and insufflation of the colon with air to provide a \\"double contrast\\" view of the colon.    CT: Axial Lower Abdomen  This is an axial image of the mid-abdomen demonstrating the position of the various segments of the colon. The hepatic flexure contains stool, which often appears bubbly due to the air within it. The transverse and descending colon are both decompressed and therefore appear small in caliber. The small bowel is high density from the ingested oral contrast.    CT: Coronal Abdomen  These images are reformatted from an oral and IV contrast enhanced abdominal CT scan. The image on the left is the most anterior and that on the right the most posterior. These images demonstrate how the colon serves to \\"frame\\" the small bowel, which is located centrally.    Lower GI Questions  Radiology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Abdominal Angiography  AP View  This is an arteriogram of the abdominal aorta, commonly called an \\"aortogram\\". The right femoral artery was cannulated with a catheter to inject contrast.    Lateral View  This is an arteriogram of the abdominal aorta, commonly called an \\"aortogram\\". The right femoral artery was cannulated and the contrast injected via a catheter placed into the abdominal aorta.    Celiac Trunk (axis) angiogram  This is a selective angiogram of the celiac trunk. Contrast has been injected through the tip of the catheter which is in the celiac trunk. Note that the bony anatomy is visible, it has not been \'subtracted\' from view. Note that the celiac trunk is at the L1 vertebral body level.    Renal CT Angiogram  This thick axial image is part of a CT angiogram, where contrast dye is injected into a peripheral vein for optimal imaging of the vasculature. This image was taken when the contrast material was in greatest concentration in the arterial system, making the arteries bright.    Superior Mesenteric Angiogram  This is a selective angiogram of the superior mesenteric artery. Note that the tip of the catheter is in the proximal SMA. Some of the injected contrast refluxes back into the aorta. Note that the bony anatomy has been \'subtracted\' from view by a computer program in order to focus on the vascular anatomy.    This is the same image unsubtracted (i.e. with bones).    Portal Venogram  This angiogram of the portal vein was obtained during a special procedure known as a TIPS procedure (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) which is performed for relief of portal hypertension. A catheter (white line descending from the middle portion of the top of the image) has been placed from the right internal jugular vein, through the superior vena cava, through the right atrium and out the right hepatic vein. The catheter then travels through the liver parenchyma and into the right branch of the portal vein. The tip of the catheter is in the splenic vein. Contrast was injected through this catheter to obtain this image.    Inferior Mesenteric Angiogram  This is a selective angiogram of the inferior mesenteric artery. The contrast is filling the inferior mesenteric artery and its branches. Note that the bony anatomy has been \'subtracted\' from view by a computer program in order to focus on the vascular anatomy.    This is same image unsubtracted (i.e. with bones). Note that in the unsubtracted image, the contrast has been excreted into the renal collecting systems.   Lateral CTA: Abdominal Aorta  This is a lateral reconstruction of a CTA showing the celiac trunk and SMA.

They are used to assess alignment of the spine, and to look for ligamentous instability (ligament tears or laxity may result in vertebral bodies slipping forward or backward on each other).    Note that the vertebral bodies remain aligned normally with movement, as is shown by the smooth, continuous posterior spinal line (green dashed line). Note the uniform widening of the interspinous spaces with flexion.    AP Cervical Spine: Vertebral Bodies  Note the numbering of the vertebral bodies.  Odontoid View  This image is taken in an AP projection with the patient\'s mouth open.    CT Cervical Spine  This images show the cervical spine from the C1/C2 level to the intervertebral disc.  CT: Cervical Spine Sagittal & Coronal  These images are reformatted from a helical CT scan of the cervical spine. They are supplementary to axial images and are useful for evaluating alignment and joint spaces. Some fractures, such as compression fractures, are easier to identify on these images, as the loss of height is easier to appreciate.  Axial CT  The following images are selected axial CTs of the neck; image 1 is the most superior, and image 6 the most inferior. These were obtained with contrast enhancement. Intravenous contrast helps to distinguish blood vessels from adjacent muscles and lymph nodes, by making them higher attenuation.  Radiology Quiz    Osteology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Face & Scalp      Eye & Orbit  Imaging the eye and orbit   Both CT and MRI are used to evaluate the contents of the orbit. When there is a history of trauma, CT is typically used since it is more sensitive for fractures of the bony margins of the orbits. On CT, when viewing soft tissue windows, the extraocular mucles, optic nerve and globe are visible, so limited assessment of these structures can also be made.  The higher soft tissue contrast of MRI results in better conspicuity of the soft tissue structures of the orbit, especially the globe. Compare the MRI and CT images shown.  MRI: Axial T1  The following are T1-weighted axial MRI images of the orbit (thin 2mm sections). The first image is the most inferior. Supsequent images are sequentially more superior. On T1 images, fat is high signal intensity (bright), fluid is low signal intensity (dark), and muscles and nerves are gray.  ]} />    MRI: Axial T2  On T2-weighted images, the high signal intensity fluid of the anterior and posterior chambers contrasts with the dark signal of the lens, making it very conspicuous. The air in the paranasal sinuses and air cells is dark.    MRI: Coronal T1  This T1-weighted MRI is in the coronal plane just posterior to the globe (eyeball). The extraocular muscles, optic nerves, and superior opthalmic vein can be seen well in this image. Fat is bright, and muscles and nerves are gray.    CT: Coronal orbit  This is an IV contrast enhanced CT. The blood vessels are opacified with the iv contrast material, which makes them high attenuation. The orbital fat is dark gray, in contrast to the medium gray density of the extraocular muscles.    CT: Axial orbit  This CT is displayed in soft tissue window.

The series moves from superior to inferior. The images are \\"windowed\\" to highlight osseous structures. Each axial image is only 1mm thick! This allows the fine structures of the inner ear to be displayed in detail.     CT: Coronal Ear   This is a coronal CT image taken at the level of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and inner ear. The tympanic membrane is a very thin structure but can be faintly seen on this 1mm thick section.  Quiz    Deep Face  CT: Axial  This is an axial CT of the face at the level of the lateral pterygoid muscle.  Radiology Quiz    Osteology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Nasal Cavity  AP Sinuses  On AP view of the sinuses, the petrous ridge of the temporal bone and mastoid air cells overlap and partially obscure the lower orbits and maxillary sinuses. In order to better evaluate the maxillary sinuses, a special view (Waters) is obtained, shown in the next image.    Waters view of the sinus  A waters view is an AP view in which the patient flexes the neck and elevates the chin so that the x-ray beam passes obliquely through the facial structures, directed from caudal to cranial. In effect, this places the orbits and maxillary sinuses above the skull base structures and petrous ridge of the temporal bone, enabling them to be visualized better than on an AP view. This patient\'s frontal sinuses are very small (hypoplastic).    Lateral sinuses  Although all of the right and left sided structures are superimposed on the lateral view, it is the best projection to show the sphenoid sinuses, which are obscured by other bony structures on the AP and Waters views. This patient has hypoplastic (underdeveloped) frontal sinuses.    CT: Coronal nasal cavity   The following images are four sequential coronal sections through the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The first image is the most anterior and subsequent images are more posterior. Remember, when looking at coronal images, the patient\'s right side is depicted on the left side of the image.  CT: Sagittal midline  This is a 10mm thick reformatted CT image of the nasal cavity showing midline structures.    CT: Axial head (pterygopalatine fossa)  This CT scan has been \\"windowed\\" (contrast adjusted) to highlight the bony structures. The pterygopalatine fossa (between the maxillary bone anteriorly and the root of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone posteriorly) can be appreciated.      Radiology Quiz    Anatomy Practice Questions    Oral Cavity & Pharynx  The air filled pharynx and trachea are lucent on this lateral view of the soft tissues of the neck.  CT: Sagittal Neck  This sagittal CT scan has been reformatted from a conventional helical (axial) CT of the neck. It is a midline sagittal view.    CT: Nasopharynx  The following images are axial, contrast enhanced CTs of the neck at the level of the nasopharynx. The first image is superior and the second more inferior.  CT: Oropharynx  The following images are axial, contrast enhanced CTs of the neck at the level of the oropharynx. The first image is superior and the second more inferior.  CT: Laryngopharynx  The following images are axial, contrast enhanced CTs of the neck taken just below the mandible, at the level of the laryngopharyx. The first image is superior and the second more inferior.    Radiology Quiz    Anatomy Practice Questions: Oral Cavity    Anatomy Practice Questions: Pharynx    Larynx  CT: Sagittal Neck  This sagittal CT scan has been reformatted from a conventional helical (axial) CT of the neck. It is approximately a midline sagittal view.    CT: Upper Larynx  This contrast enhanced CT scan of the neck is at the level of the piriform fossa & aryepiglottic folds. The laryngopharyx is relatively flattened, not distended with air.    CT: Mid Larynx  The following images from a contrast enhanced neck CT are from the mid-larynx, just below the glottis. The first image is superior and the second is more inferior. The arytenoid and corniculate cartilages are tough to differentiate from one another on a single axial image.  Radiology Quiz    Anatomy Practice Quiz    Vasculature  Aortic Arch and Neck CT Angiogram  This is a 3D reformatted image from a CTA (computed tomography angiography) of the aortic arch and neck. CT angiography is performed by scanning the patient while the injected IV contrast (dye) is in the arterial circulation. Helical images are obtained, which can subsequently be reformatted in any plane or in three-dimensions. This image is a three-dimensional volume rendered image.    Carotid CT Angiogram  This image from a CT angiogram of the neck has been reformatted in an oblique sagittal plane to evaluate the carotid bifurcation. Several of the external carotid branches can be identified. The hyoid bone and calcified thyroid cartilage are labelled to serve as reference points.   MR Angiography - Neck  This MRA (magnetic resonance angiogram) shows the aortic arch, its branches, and arteries of the neck. This image was obtained using IV gadolinium as a contrast agent, with a specialized technique allowing the backround tissues to be suppressed.    MRI: Cavernous Sinus  In these axial and coronal MRIs, the cavernous sinus can be seen with a few of its important anatomic relationships. Notice the carotid arteries flowing within the cavernous sinuses.

The abdominal radiograph is indicated for a variety of symptoms and diagnoses. As you have seen in prior radiographs, the tissue boundaries will be identified by differences in the density of adjacent tissue. In the abdomen, often it is the adipose tissue that surrounds an organ which helps to define its boundaries.  KUB Abdominal Radiograph    Intravenous Pyelogram  An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is a specialized radiographic examination of the kidneys, collecting system, and bladder. Contrast dye is injected into an intravenous line, and serial radiographs are obtained as the dye gets filtered and excreted by the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. The anatomy of the renal collecting system, ureters, and bladder, as well as subtle physiologic changes in relative kidney function, can then be assessed.    Kidney Stone  This is a radiograph of a patient with right flank pain. It shows several radiodense right renal stones. After you have reviewed this image and identified the structures, click here to see a CT scan of the same patient in order to see the specific location of the stone.  Gallstone  This is a scout image from a CT scan which shows a gallstone. Although the stone is in the right upper quadrant and could be mistaken for a kidney stone, the close association with the liver helps to identify it as a gallstone.    CT Imaging  Axial Abdomen  This is an axial CT image at the level of the kidneys. Oral and intravenous contrast had been administered prior to obtaining the image. Identify normal structures.    Abdominal Compartments  Sometimes pathology helps to demonstrate anatomy.  In the top image below, the patient has ascites, which is accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. The image below that is from a patient without ascites. The presence of ascities highlights the extent of the intraperitoneal versus retroperitoneal compartments. Fluid is darker (lower attenuation) than the surrounding abdominal wall musculature. Note how the intraperitoneal compartment is essentially bathed in ascites fluid (all around the liver, spleen, and intestines). The retroperitoneal space, where the kidneys, aorta, and vena cava reside, is not in contact with the ascites fluid. Notice these structures are surrounded by the retroperitoneal fat.     MRI Imaging  Axial Abdomen  MRI has better soft tissue contrast than CT, and can provide certain details that a CT image cannot.  This is an axial T1-weighted MRI of the abdomen. Remember that fat appears bright on a T1-weighted image and soft tissue elements (e.g. organs) appear an intermediate shade of gray. In this particular MRI sequence, moving blood appears black. Identify normal anatomy.    Coronal Abdomen  This is a T1-weighted coronal view of the abdomen. Identify normal anatomy.

In the case of radiographs of the hip, the most frequently used views are:  Anteroposterior AP hip  Lateral (\\"frog-leg\\")  AP Pelvis, including upper femora (bilateral)  Radiographs are commonly used to evaluate hip fractures, bone lesions or arthritis. They are also the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluating a patient with hip pain, or evaluating a patient following trauma. Other imaging techniques which may be used for supplemental information include:  CT: can be helpful for complex fractures and dislocations  MRI: hip pain of unknown etiology, infection, tumor, joint space abnormalities and osteonecrosis  Arthrography: evaluates joint anatomy, particularly the acetabular labrum, articular cartilage and ligaments.  AP Hip  For this view, the patient is placed in a supine position with legs together, hips and knees extended, and the feet inverted (turned inwards) 15 degrees. The foot inversion brings the anteverted femoral neck into a plane perpendicular to the radiograph. If properly positioned, the lesser trochanter should be posterior (its tip may project slightly across the medial border of the femur).    Lateral Hip (\\"frog leg\\")   The patient rests in a supine position and externally rotates, flexes, and abducts the femur (the \\"frog-leg\\" position, see figure below). As with the AP image, the x-ray beam is directed anterior to posterior across the joint.    This view can be used to evaluate many of the same structures and relations discussed in the AP view. Note in particular that the lesser trochanter is clearly visible (external rotation moves it to a more anterior position) and the greater trochanter is harder to discern (it has been rotated posteriorly). Realize that the angle of the femoral neck cannot be evaluated in this view.  AP Pelvis and Bilateral Upper Femur  This view allows assessment of symmetry of the pelvis and the proximal femurs as they articulate at the hip joint (by comparing the right and left sides).    MRI: Axial Thigh (upper)  This is an axial image of the upper thighs in a male. Fat appears bright in this image, while ligaments, cortical bone and fascia appear dark. Note that the medullary space of the femurs is white, due to the presence of fat in the marrow. Blood vessels appear dark gray or black; this is called a \\"flow void\\" and is the normal, expected appearance.    MRI: Axial Thigh (mid)  This is an axial image of the mid thigh of the right lower extremity. The right side of the image is medial, and the left side of the image is lateral. If you recall that all axial images are displayed, by convention, as though you were standing at the foot of the table and looking towards the patient\'s head, you can reason that this must be the right leg. The same imaging parameters were used as in the prior image.  MRI: Axial Thigh (lower)  This is an axial image of the lower thigh of the right lower extremity. The right side of the image is medial, and the left side of the image is lateral. If you recall that all axial images are displayed, by convention, as though you were standing at the foot of the table and looking towards the patient\'s head, you can reason that this must be the right leg. The same imaging parameters were used as in the prior image.    Thigh and Hip Questions  Radiology Quiz    Osteology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Knee and Leg  Patients are usually positioned for radiographs according to standard protocols, so that normal patterns can be discerned and abnormalities can be more readily identified. In the case of radiographs of the knee and leg, the most frequently used standard views are:  Anteroposterior (AP)  Lateral  Sunrise (knee)  These may be supplemented by oblique views. It is important to remember that multiple views of a given area may be required in order to determine the actual three-dimensional relationships. Comparison to films of the patient’s other knee can also be useful.  MRI(magnetic resonance imaging) of the knee allows excellent visualization of the internal soft tissues of the knee, including the menisci, articular cartilages, ligaments, tendons, and muscles.  CT (computed tomography) of the knee can be used to further evaluate complex fractures and other abnormalities of bone.  AP Knee  The patient is in a supine position with the knee extended. Three bones comprise the knee joint, the femur, tibia, and patella. Notice that the joint space appears large because the menisci and cartilage are not visible on a plain radiograph. In patients with degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis), there is often narrowing of the joint space due to the loss of cartilage.  AP Knee, child    The image on the left is an AP view of a child\'s knee and shows open epiphyseal growth plates. The radiograph on the right is from an adult.  In children, injury to an epiphyseal plate is especially worrisome because the fracture may devascularize the epiphysis and lead to growth disturbances.  In the radiograph of the adult knee, the bones have reached maturity and the epiphyseal plates have ossified. These epiphyseal scars indicate the prior position of the epiphyseal plates.  Lateral Knee  When taking a lateral knee film, flexion of 20 to 30 degrees is usually preferred because this position relaxes the muscles and shows the maximum volume of the joint space.    Sunrise View  The sunrise view is a tangential look at the flexed knee. The patient is positioned so that the long axis of the patella is parallel to the x-ray beam, perpendicular to the film cassette/detector. This view is used to assess the patellofemoral articulation, which may be altered by degenerative joint disease.  The femur and tibia are superimposed. Typically the medial femoral condyle is more rounded and/or prominent than the lateral femoral condyle.    MRI: Sagittal Knee  The following three MRI images of the knee are T2-weighted images in the sagittal plane, moving from lateral to medial. Fat and fluid appear bright, while ligaments, tendons, and cortical bone appear dark. Since bone marrow contains fat, it appears bright on these T2-weighted images. Muscles are shades of gray.  This image is taken through the lateral aspect of the knee.  MRI: Coronal Left Knee  The next two MRIs show the knee in the coronal plane. This image is roughly in the middle of the knee joint, and the next image is more posterior. View these images as though facing the patient. The left side of the image is medial.  These images are T2-weighted, however the fat signal has been \'suppressed\' making structures containing fat appear dark, like the subcutaneous fat and the fatty bone marrow.  MRI: Axial leg  This is an MRI of the mid-left leg. Note that tendons and cortical bone appear dark in this image, while subcutaneous fat & fat in the marrow spaces appears bright.  Dissection of the Knee    Knee Dissection (Open in New Tab)  Knee and Leg Questions  Radiology Quiz    Osteology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Foot and Ankle  The standard views for foot and ankle include:  AP radiograph of the ankle  Lateral Ankle  AP and Oblique Foot  Lateral Foot  On a lateral radiograph of the foot, most of the mid-foot and fore-foot bones overlap and are difficult to identify individually. This view is useful to demonstrate the neck of the talus and the anterior portion of the calcaneus.    Dissection of the Foot   Foot Dissection (Open in New Tab)  Foot and Ankle Questions  Radiology Quiz    Osteology Quiz    Nerves of the Lower Extremity  Femoral Nerve   The femoral nerve is formed by the ventral rami of L2-L4, specifically the posterior divisions of the lumbar plexus.  The femoral nerve travels posterior to the inguinal ligament within the muscular lacuna. The muscular lacuna also contains the iliopsoas muscle.  NAVEL is a mnemonic for remembering the neurovascular structures that travel deep to the inguinal ligament into the femoral triangle.  N = femoral nerve A = femoral artery V = femoral vein EL = empty space (femoral canal) and lymphatics  The femoral nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh, with a few exceptions: -the psoas portion of iliopsoas is innervated by muscular branches of the lumbar plexus -tensor fasciae latae is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve -pectineus is occasionally innervated by the obturator nerve  The femoral nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the anterior thigh and the anteromedial aspect of the leg. The afferent innervation of the leg is provided by the saphenous nerve (a branch of the femoral nerve that travels in the adductor canal).  Injury to the femoral nerve typically produces: weakness of hip flexion, loss of knee extension (no patellar reflex), and sensory loss over the territories described above.  Sciatic Nerve   The sciatic nerve is formed by the ventral rami of L4-S3.  The sciatic nerve is comprised of the tibial nerve and common fibular nerve surrounded by a common epineurium.  The sciatic nerve exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen, typically inferior to piriformis muscle.  The sciatic nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh, the \\"hamstring portion\\" of adductor magnus and all muscles of the leg and foot.  The sciatic nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral aspect of the leg (anterolateral and posterolateral), and almost all of the foot (exception is the medial part of the foot that is innervated by saphenous nerve).  Injury to the sciatic nerve typically produces: complete motor loss of the muscles of the posterior thigh, leg and foot; sensory loss over the territories described above.  Tibial Nerve   The tibial nerve is a component of the sciatic nerve. It is formed from the anterior divisions of the sacral plexus.  The tibial nerve travels in the posterior leg with the posterior tibial artery, in the fascial plane between the superficial and deep muscle groups. It passes posterior to the medial malleolus at the ankle (\\"Tom, Dick and very nervous Harry\\").  \\"Tom, Dick and very nervous Harry\\" is a mnemonic for remembering the structures that pass posterior to the medial malleolus at the ankle.  T = tibialis posterior tendon D = flexor digitorum tendon A = posterior tibial artery V = posterior tibial veins (usually a pair on either side of the artery) N = tibial nerve H = flexor hallucis longus tendon  The tibial nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg (both superficial and deep).  The tibial nerve provides sensory innervation to the posterior aspect of the leg (via its contribution to the sural nerve) and the sole of the foot.  The tibial nerve terminates by bifurcating into the medial and lateral plantar nerves in the sole of the foot.  Injury to the tibial nerve typically produces: loss of plantarflexion of the foot, loss of flexion of the toes and weakened inversion of the foot; sensory loss over the territories described above.  Common Fibular Nerve   The common fibular nerve is a component of the sciatic nerve. It is formed from the posterior divisions of the sacral plexus. In the past, common fibular nerve was called \\"common peroneal nerve\\".  The common fibular nerve travels around the neck of the fibula in a superficial position - here it is vulnerable to injury.  Near the neck of the fibula, the common fibular nerve divides into superficial and deep branches. Its motor and sensory innervation will be described in the context of these branches on the next two pages.  Superficial Fibular Nerve   The superficial fibular nerve arises from the common fibular nerve near the neck of the fibula.  The superficial fibular nerve travels in the lateral compartment of the leg.  The superficial fibular nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg (muscles that evert the foot).  The superficial fibular nerve provides sensory innervation to the anterolateral aspect of the leg (the distal half) and the dorsum of the foot (the exception is the webspace between the hallux and second digit).  Injury to the superficial fibular nerve typically produces loss of eversion of the foot, and sensory loss over the territories described above.  Deep Fibular Nerve   The deep fibular nerve arises from the common fibular nerve near the neck of the fibula.  The deep fibular nerve travels in the anterior compartment of the leg on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane (it travels with the anterior tibial artery).  The deep fibular nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg (muscles that primarily dorsiflex the foot and extend the toes).  The deep fibular nerve provides sensory innervation to the webspace between the hallux and second digit.  Injury to the deep fibular nerve typically produces loss of dorsiflexion of the foot, loss of extension of the toes, and sensory loss in the first webspace.  Foot Drop   Because of its superficial position, the common fibular (peroneal) nerve is the most frequently injured nerve in the lower limb.  As the common fibular (peroneal) nerve leaves the popliteal fossa, it descends on the posterior aspect of the head of the fibula. It then winds around the fibular neck (arrow) where it is susceptible to trauma, such as a blow to the lateral aspect of the leg or fracture of the neck of the fibula.  Severance of the common fibular (peroneal) nerve results in paralysis of all muscles in the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg. This loss of dorsiflexion of the ankle and eversion of the foot causes foot-drop. Because the patient is unable to make the heel strike the ground first, he will have a high stepping gait in which the affected foot is raised higher than normal so that the toes do not hit the ground. In addition, the foot is brought down suddenly, producing a “clopping” sound.  Vasculature and Angiography  Left Lower Extremity Angiogram  The video below shows a series of images from a lower extremity angiogram. A catheter was placed via the left common femoral artery with the tip positioned in the left external iliac artery. Contrast is being injected through the catheter as sequential images are obtained to follow the contrast as it travels down the arteries of the leg.  Observe the following:  The multiple branches originating from the profunda femoral artery, supplying the thigh musculature. Note the relative paucity of branches originating from the superficial femoral artery.  The relatively straight course of the popliteal artery, and its bifurcation into the anterior tibial artery, more lateral, and the tibioperoneal trunk, more medial.  The posterior tibial artery is dominant in this patient; larger in caliber than the anterior tibial, and contributing more blood flow to the foot.    Bilateral Lower Extremity Angiogram: SFA Occlusion  Contrast is being injected through a catheter that was inserted via the left common femoral artery. The catheter tip is in the distal aorta. Sequential images are obtained at multiple \\"stations\\" to follow the contrast as it travels down the arteries of the legs. The bones have been subtracted from the image.  Observe the following:  The injected contrast material mixes with the blood, opacifying it. It is propulsed antegrade down the arteries of the legs via cardiac output. As unopacified blood flows into the lower extremity, it \\"washes out\\" the high density contrast.  Blood flow in the right superficial femoral artery is slightly slower than in the left, due to a focal SFA occlusion. Branches of the right profunda femoral artery reconstitute the SFA distal to the stenosis. Note that the wash out of opacified blood is slower in the right leg than the left, due to slower flow.  There is also a focal stenosis of the right SFA/popliteal artery junction.  Femoral Artery    The femoral artery is a continuation of the external iliac artery (name changes as it passes deep to the inguinal ligament).  The femoral artery is found at the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. The femoral pulse is palpable at this midinguinal point.  NAVEL is a mnemonic for remembering the neurovascular structures that travel deep to the inguinal ligament into the femoral triangle.  N = femoral nerve A = femoral artery V = femoral vein EL = empty space (femoral canal) and lymphatics  The deep femoral artery arises in the femoral triangle. It passes deep to the adductor longus and gives rise to perforating arteries that supply the posterior thigh.  The medial and lateral femoral circumflex arteries are typically branches of the deep femoral artery. The medial branch is particularly important as it is the major blood supply to the head and neck of the  Femoral Angiogram  A catheter was placed into the left common femoral artery. Contrast injected through the catheter opacifies the left thigh vasculature. The image on the left is a digital subtraction image; the bones have been subtracted out. This results in greater conspicuity of the vascular structures.  The bony structures can be identified and used as landmarks. Names of arteries often change after they pass a certain anatomic landmark, such as the external iliac artery becoming the femoral artery distal to the inguinal ligament.    Popliteal Artery   The popliteal artery is a continuation of the femoral artery (name changes as femoral travels through the adductor hiatus).  The popliteal pulse is palpable in the popliteal fossa (pulsations are best felt in the inferior part of the fossa with the knee flexed and relaxed).  Genicular branches arise posterior to the knee joint and contribute to the collateral circulation around the knee joint.  The popliteal artery terminates by bifurcating into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.  Anterior Tibial Artery   After arising from the popliteal artery, the anterior tibial artery travels into the anterior compartment of the leg by passing between the tibia and fibula through a gap in the interosseous membrane.  Anterior tibial artery travels inferiorly on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane with the deep fibular nerve.  Anterior tibial artery primarily provides blood to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg. It also contributes to the collateral circulation of the knee and ankle, via its recurrent branch and anterior malleolar branches, respectively.  Anterior tibial artery changes its name to dorsalis pedis artery when it crosses the ankle joint.  Posterior Tibial Artery   After arising from the popliteal artery, the posterior tibial artery travels in the medial part of the posterior compartment of the leg in the fascial plane between the superficial and deep muscle groups.  At its proximal end, the posterior tibial artery gives off the fibular artery, which travels in the lateral part of the posterior compartment of the leg. The fibular artery has perforating branches that pierce the intermuscular septum to enter the lateral compartment of the leg.  The posterior tibial artery provides blood to the muscles of the posterior and lateral compartments of the leg and the sole of the foot. It also contributes to the collateral circulation of the ankle joint.  The posterior tibial artery is found posterior to the medial malleolus at the ankle in association with the same named veins and tibial nerve. The posterior tibial pulse can be palpated in this location.  \\"Tom, Dick and very nervous Harry\\" is a mnemonic for remembering the structures that pass posterior to the medial malleolus at the ankle.  Popliteal Angiogram  This image demonstrates the popliteal artery and its relationship to the bony landmarks of the knee. The image on the left is a digital subtraction angiogram. Note how this increases the conspicuity of the smaller arterial branches.    Infrapopliteal Angiogram  These are three sequential angiographic images of the left lower leg; the image on the left is the most proximal, and on the right the most distal. Bones have been subtracted from the images. The non-subtracted image is shown on the right.  Dorsalis Pedis Artery   The dorsalis pedis artery is a continuation of the anterior tibial artery (name changes when anterior tibial crosses the ankle joint).  The dorsalis pedis artery gives off two tarsal branches (medial and lateral) as it travels superior to the tarsal bones (not labeled on the diagram).  The pulse of dorsalis pedis can be felt by compressing the artery against the tarsal bones - specifically between the tendons of extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus.  Near the tarsometatarsal joint, the dorsalis pedis artery gives rise to the arcuate artery that can be compared to the dorsal carpal arch of the hand. The arcuate artery has three dorsal metatarsal arteries, which divide into dorsal digital arteries.  The dorsalis pedis artery gives rise to the first dorsal metatarsal artery directly; it then travels deep into the sole of the foot as the deep plantar artery.

Mammography has been proven to decrease deaths from breast cancer and mitigate suffering from breast cancer and breast cancer treatments. Screening mammography finds the majority of cancers before they are felt by the patient or provider. Screening mammography is able to depict breast cancer at an earlier stage – often before it has spread outside the breast.  Mammography is also used in the diagnostic setting to further characterize an abnormality found during screening or to evaluate a patient or provider’s concern about a physical examination sign or symptom. Breast ultrasound, MRI and image guided minimally invasive core biopsies are frequently performed to diagnose breast abnormalities. Screening mammography is a standardized program with federal law (The Mammography Quality Standards Act) governing the equipment, procedures and personnel.  Outcome auditing is performed regularly to assess program quality.  How Images Are Obtained    The mammographic unit is shown on the right. The breast is compressed between a plastic plate and the X-ray detector.  This compression improves the visibility of normal and abnormal structures within the breast, decreases x-ray dose and reduces patient motion during the exposure.  The gantry can rotate 360 degrees, depending on the view desired. In the position shown, it will take a cranio-caudal \\"CC\\" view.  Two standard views are obtained of each breast in a screening mammogram, the cranio-caudal \\"CC\\" view and the medio-lateral oblique view \\"MLO\\" view.  Cranio-Caudal View - the breast is compressed from top to bottom. The x-ray photons pass through the breast from the head to the feet and are registered at the detector below the breast.  Medial Lateral Oblique View - utilizing the obliquity of the pectoralis major as the axis for positioning the gantry holding the compression plate and detector, the breast is compressed obliquely, and the photons pass through the breast and are registered at the detector below. The green dot indicates the axillary tail of the breast.    Cranio-Caudal View  The x-ray photons pass through the breast from superior to inferior and are registered at the detector below the breast.  The images are viewed back to back to compare the fibroglandular tissue in each breast and optimize detection of asymmetries.  By convention the laterality markers (RCC, LCC) are always placed at the lateral aspect of the breast.    Medial Lateral Oblique View  Utilizing the obliquity of the pectoralis major as the axis for positioning the gantry holding the compression plate and detector, the breast is compressed obliquely, from axilla to the lower inner breast. The x-ray beam passes through the breast from medial to lateral.  The images are viewed back to back to compare the fibroglandular tissue and optimize detection of asymmetries. The axilla is at the top of the image and the inferior breast at the bottom.    Additional Views  Different views and techniques can be done to problem solve. Some examples include:  Magnification views – Increasing the distance from the breast to the receptor plate allows magnification and increased spatial resolution and thereby helps characterize the size and shape of calcium particles and margins of masses. The image on the left is a standard CC view and on the right a coned down, magnified view of the area of concern. The green circle highlights the mass.&#x20;  Lateral-medial (“LM”) view – The beam passes lateral to medial. This view helps depict a lesion in a true orthogonal view to facilitate directed ultrasound or core biopsy. It is also helpful in characterizing benign “milk of calcium” which layers when viewed from the side.  Spot Compression – These views use a small paddle to provide focal additional compression, to improve conspicuity of a specific area of interest.  Rolled View – The top of the breast is rolled relative to the bottom to spread out the tissues and provide information about the presence and location of findings seen only seen in one plane.  Exaggerated Lateral Cranial-caudal view (XCCL) – Used to better evaluate lateral tissue in the cranio-caudal projection.  Cleavage View – Optimizes inclusion of medial tissues in the cranio-caudal view through including  Factors Affecting Appearance  Breast Density  The composition of the breast affects the appearance of the image and the sensitivity of the study for detection of abnormal soft tissue densities. Radiologists are required to report the breast composition in their reports to alert the reader to the relative sensitivity of the study for detection of non-calcified cancers. There are four categories of breast density.  Fatty  Scattered  Heterogeneously dense  Extremely dense  The image below depicts the two extremes of breast composition.    Importance of breast compression  Compression of the breast between the plate and the detector spreads out the overlapping breast tissues. Degree of compression is measured in Lbs.  Compression helps to differentiate true masses from summation shadows that occur because of overlapping soft tissues. Compression renders the breast nearly uniform in thickness so the film density of tissues near the nipple will be similar to those near the chest wall. This also decreases the radiation dose to the breast.  Note that in this image, 33 Lbs of compression results in less overlap and improved conspicuity of the fibroglandular tissues compared with 17 Lbs.  CompressnBoth  What to look for  The normal features of the breast are scrutinized when interpreting a mammogram. The images below demonstrate normal anatomy on \'CC\' and \'MLO\' views.  Masses  Breast cancer can have several different appearances on mammography. The next few images demonstrate the most common mammographic findings of breast cancer.  The most specific sign of malignancy on mammography is a lobulated (bumpy) spiculated mass. Spiculations describe the linear strands/spikes extending outward from the mass, like spokes on a wheel.  The green circle on this image highlights a spiculated mass that is highly suspicious for cancer. This is a magnified view taken after a suspicious area was identified on the screening mammogram.  spiculatedMass  Architectural distortion  Architectural distortion is perceived as straightened lines or lines converging on a central point. This pattern is atypical for normal fibroglandular tissue, but is seen with breast carcinomas.  This image shows a standard and magnified view with the yellow box highlighting an area of architectural distortion.  ArchitecDistor  Microcalcifications  Calcifications are fairly common within the breast and are usually benign, caused by things like arterial atherosclerosis and fat necrosis.  Specific patterns of microcalcifications can be seen with carcinomas, which can be detected on mammography. Pleomorphic (irregular shapes and sizes) groups (clusters) are a sign of cancer.  This magnified view demonstrates a cluster of irregularly shaped pleomorphic calcifications.  PleiomorphicCa  New Technology  Digital Mammography  Until 2000 the detector was a piece of film in a cassette. This was known as “film screen” mammography. Among other disadvantages, film was a medium that could not be shared and could be lost or damaged.  In 2000 the FDA approved “digital mammography” systems. The detector is no longer a piece of film, rather a photon receptor that converts the photons to a digital signal that can be viewed on a high resolution monitor instead of a lightbox. Digital mammography has largely replaced film based screening. As of 2015, 95% of all units in the United States are full field digital units.  This image shows the differing conspicuity of breast tissue on film screen vs digital mammography.  film_digital  3D Tomosynthesis  Also called “3-D Mammography”, 3D tomosynthesis acquires a variable number of images in an arc-like swing of the camera and recreates the information into a series of 1 mm slices, the number of slices depending on the thickness of the compressed breast.  This method reduces overlapping tissue superimposition, improving both sensitivity and specificity.  As of 2016, the technology has gained wide acceptance because of the ability to detect 40% more invasive cancers and avert 20% of recalls (recalls are additional images obtained to clarify otherwise normal structures). As of 2016 50% of sites had at least one 3-D tomosynthesis unit.  This image is a 1mm thick image from a tomosynthesis, showing an area of architectural distortion.  3Dpic  The images obtained with tomosynthesis can be viewed as a movie. Look for the area of architectural distortion as it comes into focus in the medial breast, about midway through the video.    Interpretation  Mammograms are considered one of the more difficult studies that radiologists interpret. Specific training is federally mandated to legally interpret mammograms for signs of cancer.  All projections should be labeled stating the view and breast being displayed. The radiologist should assess if there is adequate penetration and compression of tissue.  Factors to assess  Is there adequate tissue included?  Is the pectoralis major included in MLO view?  Is the nipple in profile?  Is the retroglandular fat included?    Breast cancer  When reading a mammogram, it’s best to have a search pattern to prevent misses. Compare one breast to the other, zone by zone. They tend to be fairly symmetric. It is also essential to compare each view against older mammograms, to find subtle changes over time.  Compare the CC view of the left breast from 2015 to the image from 2016. Do you see the area of breast tissue that has changed?    New findings 2016: Note the increased density and new pleomorphic calcifications. These are very suspicious for breast cancer.

MRI capitalizes on the molecular composition of tissues to produce an image.  Unlike with CT, images can be obtained directly in the axial, coronal, or sagittal planes, and 3 dimensional volumes of data can also be obtained. Advantages of MRI include the excellent soft tissue contrast and differentiation, reducing the need for intravenous contrast enhancement, the ability to evaluate blood flow, and the ability to subtract out background tissues that are not of interest.  The goal of this module is to serve as an introduction to MRI, and to provide you with information to aid in understanding what you are looking at when you view an image.  You can view individual sections of this module using the selections on the right.  How Images Are Obtained    MRI is a technically complex imaging modality, and it is beyond the intentions of this module to discuss image acquisition in great detail. The following provides a brief summary of how MRI images are obtained and viewed.  The patient lies on a table which is moved into the bore of a large, powerful magnet (most of those in clinical use are 1.5 Tesla). Protons in the patient\'s tissues will naturally align themselves with this powerful external magnetic field.  Radio frequency pulses are sent into the patient, causing disruption of the alignment of the protons (the protons absorb energy and are displaced from their aligned position). Over time, the protons will naturally realign themselves with the external magnetic field. When this occurs, they emit the absorbed energy as radio frequency waves which are detected by the MRI scanner. These emitted radio frequency waves are the MRI signal.  The location and distribution of the emitted MRI signal is detected and analyzed by a computer, and used to produce an image. Thus, a radio frequency pulse is sent in, the patient emits a signal back which the machine reads and uses to create an image.  What types of tissue emit the MRI signal?  Only molecules with an odd number of protons have their own magnetic field and align themselves with the external magnetic field. It is these molecules that are responsible for emitting the MRI signal which is used to create the image.  Hydrogen atoms are the most abundant of these molecules in the human body and provide the basis for MRI imaging. The body is largely composed of water, and the hydrogen atoms in water are responsible for producing much of the MRI signal.  MRI images are displayed in shades of gray, like radiographs and CTs. The shade of gray that a given structure appears on MRI will vary with the MRI technique used to obtain the image. This will be discussed later in this module.    Images can be obtained directly in the axial, coronal, or sagittal plane. Like CT, axial images are viewed as though looking at the patient from the foot towards the head, placing the right side of the patient on the left of the image. Like radiographs, coronal images are viewed as though looking at the front of the patient, placing the right side of the patient on the left of the image. Sagittal images are viewed such that anterior is on the left of the image and posterior on the right.    Factors Affecting the Appearance  A myriad of factors affect the appearance of the final MRI image, including tissue composition, machine parameters such as the timing with which the radio frequency (RF) pulse is sent in and when the machine \\"listens\\" for the returning MRI signal, the use of intravenous contrast, and whether the structure being imaged is static or dynamic (i.e. flowing blood).  A complete discussion of this is beyond the goals of this introductory module. It is not necessary to memorize the physics or the appearance of certain tissues on MRI, however you should be familiar with the concepts and realize that the same structures might look different on different types of MRI images.  Tissue Composition    As discussed in \\"how images are obtained\\", hydrogen atoms provide the basis for MRI imaging of the body. Tissues which are abundant in hydrogen atoms, such as water and fat, are responsible for producing most of the MR signal. Likewise, tissues which are devoid of hydrogen atoms, such as cortical bone, do not give off much signal.  Tissues which emit a strong MRI signal will appear white on MRI images and are termed \\"high signal intensity\\" and those which emit a weak MRI signal appear blacker and are termed \\"low signal intensity\\".  This is a sagittal MRI of the cervical spine. Note the cerebrospinal fluid which has a very high water content, has a high signal intensity on this image, appearing white. In contrast, the cortical bone appears black, \\"low signal intensity\\" due to its low water content.  Contrast Enhancement  Similar to the use of intravenous contrast in CT, the conspicuity of and contrast between structures of similar composition can be augmented by the use of intravenous contrast in MRI.  The contrast used in MRI is made of gadolinium, a paramagnetic substance with a strong magnetic field. Gadolinium affects the appearance of tissues on T1 weighted images, causing tissues which take it up to appear brighter on T1 weighted images. Gadolinium is administered to the patient by intravenous injection. Tissues that appear brighter on images obtained after gadolinium are said to \\"enhance\\".  The first image is a T1 weighted axial image of the abdomen. The next image was obtained after intravenous gadolinium was administered. Note that the kidneys, aorta and pancreas are brighter due to the gadolinium. In addition, the renal medulla and cortex can be differentiated on the enhanced images, as they have taken up different amounts of gadolinium. Tumors and other abnormal tissues take up gadolinium differently from normal tissues, and gadolinium is to augment detection of these.  Unlike CT, not all MRI images are obtained the same way, and as a result, the images can look quite different. MRI machine parameters, such as the strength of the RF pulse, the timing of repetitive RF pulses, the time the machine \\"listens\\" for the returning signal from the patient can all be selected and manipulated to create specific types of images and to optimize visualization of certain structures.  Two common \\"sequences\\" or types of MRI images which you should be familiar with are T1 and T2 weighted images. The images are \\"weighted\\" to bring out various characteristics of tissues. Some tissues look the same on both T1 and T2 images and some look different.      These sagittal lumbar spine MRI images are both T1 weighted and T2 weighted. Note that subcutaneous fat is bright on both images. The cerebrospinal fluid is dark on T1 and bright on T2. Note the difference in the appearance of the intervertebral discs on the two images. The central portion of a disc contains fluid and so appears brighter on T2 than T1.  It is not necessary to understand the physics or memorize the appearances of tissues on T1 or T2 weighted images. The goal of this section is for you to become familiar with the concepts and realize why the same structures might look so different on different MRI images or \\"sequences\\".  The two images the below are the same axial section of the upper abdomen. The image on the top is T1 weighted and the image on the bottom is T2 weighted. Note the fluid filled gallbladder and the cerebrospinal fluid are different shades of grayscale on the two types of images. Also note that the soft tissues, such as the liver, appear slightly different shades of gray on the two sequences.  Blood vessels, such as the aorta (labeled above) are even more complex. Not only do the machine parameters affect their appearance, but the speed and direction in which the blood flows also impacts the final image.  Anatomical Structures  MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and can readily demonstrate and differentiate adjacent soft tissue structures, far superior to that possible with CT.  Everything is so beautifully seen on MRI that it is easier to discuss what isn\'t well seen. Air does not give off an MRI signal and produces a void on MRI, thus air containing structures such as the lung appear black. Likewise, MRI of the bowel is limited due to the presence of intestinal gas. Bowel peristalsis also causes motion artifact, limiting the utility of MRI in the evaluation of the bowel.  Abdomen  The images below were both obtained without iv contrast enhancement. The image on the top is a CT and the image on the bottom is a T2 weighted MRI. Note that on the CT all of the blood vessels and solid organs (liver, pancreas, spleen and kidneys) appear the same shade of gray. Note that on the MRI all of these structures are subtly different shades of gray, allowing us to distinguish them. Also note that the portal vein can be discretely seen from the adjacent pancreas on MRI, and individual nerve roots of the spinal canal are visible.    The image below is a T2 coronal MRI image of the abdomen. Note that the lungs appear black, since air does not give off an MRI signal.  mri-structures-1  The next image is a T1 axial image of the abdomen. Note the fuzzy, ill defined margins of the bowel. This is caused by motion artifact, as the bowel is constantly moving (peristalsing). In the evaluation of bowel, CT is superior to MRI. The remaining soft tissues are well demonstrated, including the muscles of the back and abdominal wall.    Extremities  Ligaments, tendons and cartilage are easily displayed and evaluated on MRI, as demonstrated on the below coronal MRI of the knee. This \\"internal anatomy\\" of joints can only be seen with MRI, not with any other type of radiologic imaging.  Soft tissues of the extremities are also better evaluated with MRI than other imaging modalities, as demonstrated on the next image which is an axial MRI of the thigh. The medium gray muscles can be differentiated from the darker tendons, and the bright intervening fat helps to make individual muscles conspicuous. Note that the sciatic nerve is even discretely seen!  Important to note is that dense cortical bone, such as of the femur, appears black. Cortical bone has a low water content and gives off very little signal. CT is superior for evaluating cortical bone. In contrast, the medullary bone, containing the bone marrow, does give off MRI signal and can be adequately seen on MRI.  Pelvis  These are axial and sagittal T2 weighted MRI images of the female pelvis. The uterus and ovaries are beautifully displayed on MRI. The different soft tissue components of the uterus can be differentiated on the sagittal image; the endometrium is bright and the myometrium is darker. Note that the ovarian follicles are seen as white (fluid filled) structures. The final image shows CT image of the pelvis to compare with the MRI images. The rectum, pelvic sidewalls, prostate and seminal vesicles are also well seen on MRI.  Brain and Spinal Column  The following images show an axial T2 MRI of the spine, and an axial T2 MRI of the brain which includes the orbits.  The darker spinal cord is seen discretely, surrounded by the brighter subarachnoid fluid. The white dot in the center of the spinal cord is an abnormal fluid filled cavity, called a syrinx. The nucleus pulposis, the fluid component of the intervertebral disc, can be differentiated from the annulus fibrosis, the outer dark fibrous band of the intervertebral disc.  These images demonstrate how exquisitely the internal anatomy of the brain and spinal cord is seen. No other imaging modality can compare with MRI for imaging the central nervous system.  Indications and Specialized MRI Techniques  Since MRI has excellent soft tissue contrast, its greatest use is for evaluating soft tissue structures, as discussed previously in this module. MRI is indicated in the evaluation of joints and soft tissue tumors and masses of the extremities. In the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, MRI is indicated in the evaluation of congenital or structural abnormalities, tumors or other masses of organs and soft tissues. MRI is indicated to evaluate the brain, face, spinal cord and spine for a wide variety of symptoms and problems. Specialized techniques include specifically imaging blood vessels and fluid filled structures.  Tumors  MRI is widely used to evaluate for tumors throughout the body, including the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, extremities, spine and brain. It is excellent in the evaluation of brain tumors. The two images demonstrate brain tumors in two different patients. The images were obtained after IV contrast was given, and the tumor tissue has taken up the contrast and appears brighter than the adjacent brain parenchyma on these T1 weighted images.    Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)  This specialized technique takes advantage of the flow properties of blood vessels to obtain images. MRA is commonly used to evaluate arterial blood flow to the central nervous system. It is also used to evaluate arterial blood flow to the extremities, abdominal organs and the intestines.  MRA displays the caliber of a blood vessel, allowing evaluation for occlusions, stenosis or aneurysms, for congenital abnormalities, and for the presence of blood clots or atherosclerosis.  The image below is an MRA of the arch of the aorta, the subclavian arteries and arteries of the neck. Note the arteries appear bright, while the background tissues are dark and not well seen with this specialized angiographic technique.  mri-indications-mra  Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV)  This specialized technique takes advantage of the flow properties of veins to obtain images.  MRV is commonly used to evaluate venous drainage from the central nervous system. The image below is a sagittal view of an MRV of the brain. Flowing blood in the veins appears white while the background tissue is poorly seen. Blood flow in the arteries is not seen with this technique.  mri-indications-mrv  MRV is also commonly used to evaluate the veins of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and extremities, to detect abnormal areas of narrowing or dilatation or for the presence of blood clots.  MRCP  Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography  This specialized technique takes advantage of how bright fluid appears on T2 weighted images in order to specifically display fluid containing structures. The bile within the biliary ducts of the liver, the common bile duct and gallbladder, and the fluid in the pancreatic duct all appear very bright on these specialized images, while the background tissue is poorly seen.  mri-indications-mrcp  MRCP is commonly used to evaluate for obstruction of the bile ducts or pancreatic ducts, for stones within the ducts or gallbladder, and for congenital anomalies of these structures.  A normal coronal MRCP is shown above. Note how well the fluid containing structures are seen. The stomach and duodenum contain fluid in this patient, so they are visible as well.

In some cases, the CT data is acquired as a helix of density data which is then reformatted into the axial, coronal, or sagittal planes.  Head CTs can be performed without iv contrast (unenhanced), or following iv contrast injection (enhanced), depending on what the clinical situation is.  On enhanced scans, the arteries, veins, dura and meninges all become brighter since they take up the contrast.  The blood brain barrier prevents the contrast from being taken up by the brain parenchyma, so it does not become brighter.  This is an enhanced CT of the brain after intravenous contrast was administered.  Axial PD-weighted MRI  MRIs are acquired as thin slices in the axial, coronal, or sagittal planes.  PD (proton density) weighting is a technique used to acquire the images that results in a standard, specific appearance of normal tissues.  On PD images of the brain, fluid appears light gray, and can be hard to differentiate from gray matter.  Gray matter is also light gray, and white matter is darker gray.  On PD images, the contrast between white and gray matter is excellent.  Most vessels are black.  The subcutaneous fat is white.  Axial T2-weighted MRI  MRIs are acquired as thin slices in the axial, coronal, or sagittal plane.  T2 weighting describes the technique used to acquire images in a particular way that causes fluid to look bright (white).  Gray matter appears mid to light gray, and white matter is darker than gray matter.  Most vessels are black.  The subcutaneous fat is sometimes white, and sometimes dark, such as if a technique called ‘fat saturation’ has been employed.  Sagittal T1-weighted MRI  MRIs are obtained as thin slices in the axial, coronal, or sagittal planes.  T1 weighting is a technique used to acquire images in which fluid appears dark/black.  Gray matter appears dark gray, and white matter is lighter than gray matter.  The appearance of blood vessels is variable.  In the series that follows, the large vessels, like the carotid arteries and circle of Willis arteries are white. The subcutaneous fat is white.  Coronal T2-weighted MRI  MRIs are acquired as thin slices in the axial, coronal, or sagittal plane.  T2 weighting describes the technique used to acquire images in a particular way that causes fluid to look bright (white).  Gray matter appears mid to light gray, and white matter is darker than gray matter.  Most vessels are black.  The subcutaneous fat is sometimes white, and sometimes dark, like when a technique called ‘fat saturation’ has been employed, as is the case in the series of coronal images which follows.             Conventional Cerebral Angiography  Aortic Arch    These images were aquired by rapid injection of iodinated contrast material through a catheter placed into the ascending aorta, with rapid sequential radiographs obtained.  The image is aquired in a left anterior oblique projection, which optimizes viewing of the arch and great vessels origins. On this image, the bones are included. On the subsequent images, the bones have been \'subtracted\', which increases the conspicuity of the opacified vessels.  Internal Carotid (AP)   These images were aquired by rapid injection of iodinated contrast material through a catheter placed into the right internal carotid artery, with rapid sequential radiographs obtained.  The image is aquired in an antero-posterior (AP) projection, which optimizes viewing of the internal carotid artery bifurcation. The cavernous segment of the carotid artery is superimposed, and the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery is not well visualized in this projection.  On this image, the bones are included. On the subsequent images, the bones have been \'subtracted\', which increases the conspicuity of the opacified vessels. Only the proximal aspects of the vessels are opacified well on this early image.  Carotid Angiogram Venous Phase  The injected contrast has now passed through the arterial circulation and into the venous circulation, opacifying small cortical veins and the dural venous sinuses.    Internal Carotid (Lateral)   These images were aquired by rapid injection of iodinated contrast material through a catheter placed into the right internal carotid artery, with rapid sequential radiographs obtained.  The image is aquired in a lateral projection, which optimizes viewing of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery. The course of the anterior cerebral artery is seen, parallelling the corpus callosum. The bifurcation of the internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery are not well visualized in this projection.  On this image, the bones are included. On the subsequent images, the bones have been \'subtracted\', which increases the conspicuity of the opacified vessels.  Venous Phase  The injected contrast has passed through the arterial circulation and into the venous system, opacifying the cortical and deep veins and dural venous sinuses. The field of view is small, and portions of the patient\'s skull are excluded from the image; thus the entirety of the superior sagittal sinus is not seen.    Vertebral Artery (AP)  The bones have been subtracted from this image. The contrast has been injected from a catheter placed into the right vertebral artery. Both the right and left vessels originating from the basilar artery will be opacified with either a right or left vertebral injection, and contrast often refluxes down the contralateral vertebral artery.  Venous Phase  Contrast has passed through the arterial circulation and into the veins, opacifying the dural venous sinuses draining the occipital lobes and cerebellum.    Vertebral Artery (Lateral)  Venous Phase  Contrast has passed through the arterial circulation and into the veins, opacifying the dural venous sinuses draining the occipital lobe and cerebellum. The right and left transverse and sigmoid sinues and internal jugular veins are opacified and overlap on the image.    Non-Invasive Cerebral Angiography  CT Angiography    These images were aquired with CT following rapid injection of iodinated contrast material through an arm vein. The scan was obtained while the contrast was located in the arterial circulation.  The data has been reformatted into a 3D image with a volume rendering technique. Only high density structures, like the contrast opacified vessels and the skull base, are displayed in this image. View the image as though the calvarium has been removed and you are looking down onto the skull base and circle of Willis.  CT Angiogram Anterior Circulation  This is a 3D volume rendered image of the anterior circulation, seen from an AP projection.    CT Angiogram Posterior Circulation  This is a 3D volume rendered image of the posterior circulation, seen from an AP projection.    MR Angiography  MR Angiography - Brain (AP)  MRA of the circle of Willis vessels can be performed without iv contrast enhancement. The technique capitalized on the properties of flowing blood. Vessels appear white on this type of image, and the background tissues are suppressed.  The images are reformatted to demonstrate the anterior and posterior circulation separately.    MR Angiography - LAO projection  This image is obtained in the left anterior oblique (LAO) projection, which shows the cavernous segments of the internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery bifurcation better than the AP projection.    MR Angiography - RAO projection  This image is obtained in the right anterior oblique (RAO) projection. By viewing both the LAO and RAO projections, the bifurcations of the middle cerebral and internal carotid arteries can be accurately evaluated on both the right and left sides.    MR Angiography - Posterior Circulation (AP)  This image shows only the posterior circulation. The anterior circulation has been removed from the data displayed.    MR Angiography - Posterior Circulation (Lateral)  This image shows only the posterior circulation. Since the vertebral arteries and branches of the basilar artery are superimposed, the right and left cannot be distinguished.    Circle of Willis: MR and CT Angiograms  Both of the images shown are reformatted images from an CT angiogram and MR angiogram of the head. Both are viewed from a superior aspect; as though the brain has been removed and you are looking at the circle of willis from above. The anterior cranial fossa is at the top of the image, and the foramen magnum would be at the bottom of the image. Notice the anatomy seen with each is slightly different; on the MRA, the entire course of the internal carotid arteries is visible, while on the CTA, it is partially obscured by the dense bone. Images are from two different patients.  MR Venography  MR Venography (AP)  These images are created without using IV contrast. The technique used capitalizes on the magnetic properties of flowing blood, which appears white on the image. The background tissues are suppressed.    MR Venography (Lateral)  Structures on the right and left sides of the head are superimposed on this image. Intravenous contrast is not needed for this technique.

While most images created in radiology are direct depictions of anatomy and structure, nuclear medicine studies are depictions of physiology and function. The studies are specifically designed to take advantage of changes in function that occur with pathologic processes. Functional changes often become apparent earlier than derangement of macroscopic anatomy, making nuclear imaging highly sensitive.  This introduction serves to explain the basis for, and techniques utilized to create nuclear medicine imaging studies and will guide you to an understanding of nuclear imaging. The role that nuclear medicine plays in the rapidly developing field of personalized medicine will also be touched upon.  The tracer principle  The key to understanding nuclear medicine is the realization that when disease occurs, the physiologic processes at the site of disease change. This will be elucidated with the three most commonly performed examinations:  FDG PET for malignancy evaluation  Bone scans  Myocardial perfusion scans.  FDG PET for malignancy evaluation  Nuclear imaging for malignancy exploits the differences in the way the tumor functions relative to normal tissue. The majority of malignancies have excessively high energy demands and meet these by metabolizing glucose. Thus, the glucose uptake by most tumors is markedly elevated compared to background (normal) tissue.  The glucose uptake in the body can be measured and imaged by administering a small dose of a glucose analog labeled with a radiation emitter (fluoro-deoxy glucose or FDG) intravenously and then placing the patient into a scanner (which is a radiation detector). Areas of malignancy will be manifest as sites of increased uptake of FDG. The FDG administered is a “tracer.” It will distribute in a manner similar to glucose but will have no impact on the body: it does not change organ function, is not recognized as a foreign substance and will cause no apparent side effects (other than the uncertain impact that people receive from low doses of radiation). In effect, only a “trace” dose is given.  Bone scans  Bone scans are a depiction of bone turnover. Almost all processes that cause bone injury lead to a reparative process accomplished by increasing bone turnover. These scans are performed by administering a radio-labeled phosphate compound (methylene diphosphonate or MDP) intravenously. The phosphate is incorporated into the skeleton and areas of increased turnover (as occurs with skeletal metastases, fractures or osteomyelitis) are identified with the scanner.  Myocardial perfusion scans  Finally, myocardial perfusion scans are performed principally for the evaluation of blood flow to the left ventricle. The tracers available (including sestamibi and tetrofosmin) are picked up by myocardial mitochondria relative to coronary flow. The state of flow to the heart is typically evaluated during phases of both rest and stress (usually with treadmill exercise or simulated with a vasodilator) for the detection of coronary artery disease.  Isotopes and emissions  An element is defined by its atomic number (number of protons), but may have multiple different isotopes: versions of that element with different numbers of neutrons and, therefore, different atomic weights. For example, carbon (six protons) has multiple isotopes: carbon-11, carbon-12, carbon-14. Some isotopes may be stable and some are radioactive. Some elements have no stable isotopes. Radioactive elements undergo decay events and emit energy. Energy can be emitted in multiple forms, either as energetic particles (e.g., alpha and beta particles) or as photons (having no mass; e.g., x-rays and gamma rays). Only photons are used to create images. Most studies are performed with gamma rays.  The four most commonly used isotopes in clinical nuclear medicine are:  Technetium-99m - used for a wide variety of study types  Indium-111 - for tagged white blood cell scans  Iodine-131/123 - thyroid imaging  Fluorine-18 - PET imaging  Scanners and techniques  The scanners used in nuclear medicine are, much like Geiger counters, radiation detectors; they emit no radiation. Scanners record the photons being emitted from the patient, who becomes the source of radiation following the administration of the isotope. The emissions can be quantified, localized, and converted into images.  Gamma cameras v PET scanners  Scanners can be grouped into two large, but quite distinct, categories: gamma cameras and PET scanners. They are both radiation (photon) detectors that convert the emissions into images.  Gamma cameras count photons emitted, one at a time. The most commonly used isotope in gamma cameras is technetium-99 metastable or (Tc-99m). PET scanners are used exclusively for studies performed with positron emitting isotopes. (A positron is a beta particle with a positive charge). After emission from a nucleus, it will travel a short distance and then undergo what is known as “annihilation” with an electron. In the annihilation reaction, the mass of the positron and of the electron are converted completely into energy in the form of two photons traveling in opposite directions. The scanner needs to detect both photons simultaneously for it to be counted. The most commonly used isotope in PET scanners is fluorine-18 (F-18).  Planar vs. tomographic images    Simply, planar imaging is a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional object (think chest x-ray).  Some studies are typically done in a planar format (e.g. bones scans). The image on the right is a bone scan of a patient with prostate cancer, anterior view on the left and posterior view on the right. Areas of high radiotracer uptake are black. Multiple areas of intensely increased activity in the axial and appendicular skeleton represent sites of metastases.  A gamma camera can be stationary and acquire planar images, as shown, or it can rotate around the patient and acquire tomographic images (more details on tomographic imaging are on the next page).  Tomographic imaging is a two dimensional representation of a two dimensional object (think slices from a CT). In actuality, CT images do have some thickness, but not much. Tomographic images are created by rotating a gamma camera around the patient while taking pictures and then using a computer to reconstruct the image (hence, “computed tomography”-A CT scanner does this with x-rays).  A gamma camera does the same with the gamma rays emitted by the patient, creating tomographic images known as SPECT: single photon emission computed tomography. A gamma camera can take planar images or tomographic (SPECT) images. Some studies are done exclusively in tomographic format (cardiac perfusion scans). The image displayed here is a dual headed gamma camera. There is a head positioned above the patient table (labeled “1”) and the second head is underneath and obscured by the table. The heads can stay stationary, to acquire planar images, or rotate around the patient to acquire tomographic images. The scanner shown is also a hybrid scanner which combines a CT scanner (the ring labelled \\"Symbia\\") and a gamma camera.  scanner-1  Hybrid imaging  Because nuclear studies are depictions of functional processes, the images have low spatial resolution and poor anatomic detail. It is often necessary to view them in conjunction with anatomic studies (like radiographs and CT scans) to provide useful additional localizing information. To improve this process, hybrid cameras were developed, such as the PET-CT. A PET-CT scanner performs both the CT scan and the PET scan, and the hardware for both studies is ‘housed’ in the same unit. This allows the images to be overlain, or “registered.” Following the wide clinical acceptance of PET-CT, gamma cameras were coupled to CT scanners, called SPECT CT (see prior page) to improve anatomic localization of tomographic nuclear images. PET-MRI is now available as well.  The image shown is a PET-CT. This device combines a PET scanner (which acquires tomographic images) and a CT scanner under one housing. Be aware that with PET-CT, there are two sources of radiation exposure to the patient, one from the CT scan, and one from the injected radiotracer.  scanner-2  Terminology & image display    Nuclear images are most commonly depicted in grayscale, although studies can be depicted in color as well.  On grayscale images, by most conventions, areas of high radiotracer uptake are displayed in black, and areas of low uptake are white, with varying intermediate shades of gray. Areas of high uptake are commonly called “hot or radiotracer avid”. Areas of low uptake are called “cold or photopenic”.  The bone scan images shown are from two different time points. That on the left shows a hot spot in the medial left knee (red arrow) due to increased tracer uptake from bone turnover related to osteoarthritis. The patient then had a total knee replacement using a metal prosthesis. The bone scan on the right, done post-operatively, shows a cold spot in the left knee (yellow arrow) corresponding to the metal prosthesis, which cannot take up any tracer.  Indications for nuclear imaging  The scans offered in nuclear medicine are numerous, diverse, and cover all organ systems. Presently, the most commonly performed studies are FDG PET-CT, myocardial perfusion scans and bone scans.  FDG PET-CT  FDG is fluoro-deoxy glucose (a glucose analog labeled with a radioactive isotope of fluorine, F-18). Scanning with FDG gives a depiction of glucose metabolism throughout the body. A majority of malignancies are highly dependent on glucose for energy and avidly pick up this tracer. This includes such common tumors as lung, breast cancer, and lymphoma. FDG PET-CT has proven highly valuable for diagnosis, the evaluation of treatment response and the monitoring of recurrence. The images shown are from a PET-CT in a smoker with an indeterminate lung nodule. The coronal PET image (right) shows intense activity in the right upper lobe corresponding to a nodule demonstrated on the accompanying CT (left). This indicates the presence of markedly increased glucose metabolism, consistent with (and subsequently biopsy proven to be) lung cancer. (Also note the intense tracer uptake by the myocardium, since cardiac muscle can utilize glucose for metabolism).  indication-1  Myocardial perfusion scans  Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a method to map blood flow to the left ventricle. The most commonly used tracers are Tc-99m sestamibi, Tc-99m tetrofosmin and thallium-201 chloride. Scans are usually performed for the detection of ischemic heart disease, assessment of the significance of a coronary stenosis and the follow up of patients after therapy. Most often patients will be scanned in two stages: during rest and under stress (induced by either exercise or simulated with a vasodilator). Areas of the myocardium with poor radiotracer uptake are called ‘defects’. Those that occur during stress typically represent ischemia and those found at both stress and rest indicate myocardial infarction.  The myocardial perfusion scan shows left ventricular radiotracer uptake during stress (treadmill exercise, top row) and at rest (bottom row). Stress images show reduced tracer uptake in the lateral wall (arrow) indicating stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery.  myocardial-1  Bone scans    Bone scans, or skeletal scintigraphy are performed with a radiolabeled phosphate analog (most commonly Tc-99m MDP). Bone turnover is a continual process; pathology that causes bone injury will lead to bone repair and the increased incorporation of phosphates and MDP. The processes typically evaluated with bone scans are skeletal metastatic disease, fractures and osteomyelitis. The most common indications are the staging and follow up of patients with prostate and breast cancer.  Shown on the right is the same bone scan shown earlier in this module, demonstrating multifocal \\"hot spots\\" due to prostate cancer metastasis to the spine, ribs and pelvis.

Two views (PA and lateral) are obtained at 90 degrees from each other in order to gain an appreciation of dimensionality.  Structures of the chest wall can be evaluated on radiographs. The breast tissue cannot be evaluated on standard CXR due to poor visualization of the breast parenchyma.    Chest Wall  Lateral Chest  In the lateral view, the anterior and posterior limits of the thoracic cavity are visible.    PA Chest  This is a normal PA chest xray. When the image is taken, the scapula is protracted to minimize its overlap with the chest wall. Can you see where the medial border of the scapula is overlapping with the chest wall? Notice that the anterior and posterior parts of the ribs are superimposed. The portion of the rib that is more horizontal is the posterior part, while the anterior part of the rib slopes from superior to inferior.    BONUS: Counting ribs on a CXR is a skill that requires some practice. Radiologists typically find rib 1 and count from there. On the right side of the patient, see if you can find the intersection between the anterior part of the 5th rib and the posterior part of the 8th rib. When you add the labels to the image a dot will appear at this intersection.  Lung Anatomy   Lung Dissection (Open in New Tab)  PA Chest  Air does not absorb X-ray beams, so areas filled with air, such as the lungs and bronchial tree, appear dark on a CXR. Notice that there are white \\"streaks\\" in the lungs, especially near the hilum. These streaks are formed by the branches of the bronchial tree and pulmonary vessels. Notice that in a normal chest film, the right hemidiaphragm is slightly higher than the left hemidiaphragm.    Lateral Chest  A lateral film is taken with the left side of the patient against the detector plate to reduce magnification of the heart (structures farther from the detector become magnified). Because of this, the right ribs are slightly magnified and appear larger than the left ribs. Notice that the right and left lungs are superimposed on a lateral film.  Lobar Anatomy - PA  Portions of each lobe of the lung are superimposed on one another on a CXR. Because of this, it is not always possible to pinpoint the lobar location of a nodule on a PA CXR.  Lobar Anatomy - Lateral  The lower lobes of each lung are completely superimposed on one another on a lateral CXR, and portions of the upper and right middle lobes are superimposed.

Radiographs are utilized throughout all specialties of clinical medicine, and they are widely accessible and fairly inexpensive.  This module serves as an introduction to radiography. It discusses basic principles and will supply you with information to help you understand what you are looking at when you view an image. What causes a structure to look black, white, or gray on a radiograph?  Why are some structures seen better than others?  How Images Are Obtained  Radiographs are images that are obtained using ionizing radiation. An X-ray passes through a patient to hit a specialized detector.  Historically, images were created and printed on film. Currently, radiography has become digitalized and the images are viewed on specialized computer workstations.  X-rays are discrete quantities of electromagnetic radiation that are produced outside the nucleus of an atom. X-rays are produced in a generator by the interaction of an electron beam with a Tungsten target. The X-rays are emitted from the generator as a beam and travel through a patient.  Tissues absorb (attenuate) some of the x-rays, while others pass through and hit the cassette.  The attenuation properties vary among different tissue types, resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of X-rays emerging from the patient to hit the detector (historically called a cassette).  Xrayunit  Screen-film radiography:  The cassette contains film and intensifying screens. When the X-rays hit the film, a photochemical interaction occurs, causing the metallic silver in the film to precipitate. This renders the film black when it is developed chemically.  Digital (computed) radiography: The cassette contains a photo-stimulable phosphor detector system.  When the X-rays hit the cassette, a fraction of the absorbed energy is trapped in the detector.  A red laser light stimulates the emission of the trapped energy, and blue-green light is emitted, collected, and converted into an electric signal.  This is digitized and stored as a pixel value, with the gray scale dependent upon the amount of energy absorbed & released.  Viewing the Image    A radiograph is a 2 dimensional image.  It is a summation of all of the structures through which the x-ray beam passed as it traveled through the patient.  Structures are superimposed on the film, and depth cannot be determined; when viewing an image, you cannot tell if a structure is anterior or posterior.  Films are viewed as though you were standing face to face with the patient. The patient\'s right side is displayed on the left of the image, and the left side on the right.  The more that the x-ray beam is absorbed by the tissues it passes through, the lighter the structure appears on the X-ray image.  Tissues that absorb more of the X-rays look whiter on the image, such as the ribs, while tissues which absorb less of the X-rays appear blacker on the image, such as air.  Factors Affecting the Appearance  The composition, thickness and shape of a structure all interact to influence what an object looks like on a radiograph.  Density  What causes a structure to appear black, white, or gray on a radiograph?  It is dependent on how much of the x-ray beam is absorbed by the structure vs how much passes through to reach the detector. The density of the object being imaged determines how much of the x-ray beam will be absorbed.  Dense structures absorb (attenuate) more of the x-ray beam than less dense structures. Thus, less of the beam passes through to hit the cassette and these structures appear white,  termed radioopaque. The radiograph shown is a pair of metal scissors, which are radioopaque. Note the scissors are brighter white in areas where the metal is thicker, like the handles.  Other dense structures include calcium, barium and iodine, all of which look white on radiographs. Barium and iodine will be discussed in later sections of this module.    Structures which are not very dense, such as air, absorb very little of the x-ray beam. Most of the beam passes through the air and strikes the detector. As a result, these structures appear black on x-rays, termed radiolucent. Note that on the radiograph shown, air surrounding the scissors is black.  The variable densities of structures in the body result in the four basic radiographic densities:  Air - black  Fat - gray/black  Soft tissues and organs -  gray  Metal, calcium, and bone - white  Fat is low density, but is slightly greater than air and so looks less black on a radiograph than air. Muscles, organs, and soft tissues are shades of gray, ranging from light to dark gray depending on the structure’s density. These shades of gray are referred to as water density.  This radiograph shows three cups containing substances of different densities. Which is the most dense?  fluid-densities  The cup on the far right is empty, containing only air, which is very low in density and therefore appears black. Low density structures are also called radiolucent.  The center cup contains water. Fluid is denser than air, and thus it will attenuate more of the beam and appear an intermediate shade of gray.  Do you know what is in the cup on the left?  It is barium, a very dense liquid which attenuates much of the beam and so appears white on radiographs.  For some radiology procedures, patients drink barium to opacify the gastrointestinal tract and make it visible using x-rays.    Thickness    The thicker a structure is, the more of the x-ray beam it will absorb (attenuate). As a result, thicker structures will appear whiter on radiographs than thinner structures of the same composition.  The top two images on the right are photographs of a metal step plate, one from the side view (lateral) and the other from above. The plate is made of a uniform material of successive thickness; section 1 is the thinnest and 10 the thickest. The lowest image on the right is a radiograph of the same step plate taken from above. Note that the thicker segments of the step plate are more radiodense.  The variations in the grayscale correspond to changes in plate thickness.  Below is a radiograph of two cups of water. Notice that they are the same shade of gray on this image because the thickness (diameter) of each cup is the same.    How do you think each would look if a radiograph was taken of them from the top (looking down into each glass)? Why might they appear different shades of gray when imaged from above?  This is a radiograph of the same cups of water taken from above. Why does the cup on the left look whiter?    Remember that the cup on the left contained more fluid than that on the right. Therefore, more of the x-ray beam was attenuated as it passed through, causing a whiter appearance on x-ray.  Shape  The shape of an object will affect its final appearance on radiography. The shape affects how much of the x-ray beam is attenuated by a structure, mostly because of differences in thickness. For example, if looking at a round structure of uniform composition, like a solid ball, the center will appear denser, or whiter on a radiograph than the edges because the center is thicker and attenuates more of the x-ray beam.  The radiograph below shows a more complex structure; a green pepper.  pepper_combo  As you know, the inside of a pepper is comprised of air, and the walls are the \\"flesh\\". Area B appears more lucent (black) than area A, despite the fact that the outer wall of the pepper is of uniform thickness. This is because the x-rays passing through area B had to go through the flesh of only the front and back wall, while those passing through area A had to pass through much more of the flesh, as the beam traveled down the barrel where the wall of the pepper curves. As a result, more of the beam was attenuated and the lateral walls of the pepper appear whiter.    Do you know what these radiographs are of? That on the left is taken from above and that on the right from the side. It is an artichoke, and as you can see, has a complex appearance on radiography. Note that the outermost leaves, which can be seen in isolation, are very lucent, except at the tips where they curl in somewhat and appear denser due to some overlap. The choke, or center of the artichoke is the whitest area, due to its density and thickness in comparison to the fine leaves. The image taken from the side shows the air intervening between the leaves.  What Anatomical Structures Are Well Seen  Radiodense structures are easy to evaluate on radiography. Examples of these include bone, calcium, barium and metal. Radiolucent structures are also easy to evaluate. Examples of these include air and fat. Structures of intermediate density, such as fluid and soft tissues like organs and muscles are harder to evaluate and differentiate. They all appear a similar shade of gray. How distinctly they are seen on radiographs depends on what structures they are next to.  If two structures of similar density are adjacent to one another, they cannot be differentiated since they appear the same shade of gray. In contrast, adjacent structures of differing densities, like bone and fat, can be distinguished quite easily.    Let\'s use this radiograph to examine how various tissues look on x-ray. Bones are radiodense and appear white. Look at the ribs and clavicles.  Air does not attenuate much of the x-ray beam. Structures that don\'t attenuate much of the beam appear black (\\"radiolucent\\"). Since the lungs are composed primarily of air, they appear black on radiographs.  Soft tissues are displayed in varying shades of gray. They are only well seen when there is tissue next to them of very different composition. For example, on the CXR, the edge of the heart is seen discretely from the lungs due to the significant difference in their densities. However, one cannot differentiate internal structures of the heart or mediastinum (like the aorta and pulmonary arteries) because these tissues have similar densities, attenuate the X-ray beam similarly, and therefore look the same on x-rays.    This is a radiograph of the upper abdomen.  Most of the abdomen is occupied by soft tissue structures which are difficult to differentiate from one another. The gas that fills the stomach and bowel (intestines) appears black and makes these structures visible. The bowel that is filled with food or fluid is not well seen, as it blends into the background gray appearance of the other soft tissue structures of the abdomen.  Fat is slightly more radiolucent than other soft tissues and appears blacker; see the preperitoneal fat stripe in the right side of the abdomen.  Indications For Use  Radiographs are commonly obtained to work up a wide variety of problems and symptoms of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, extremities and spine. Radiographs are relatively inexpensive, widely available, and easily accessible.  It is beyond the intentions of this submodule to discuss all of the potential uses of radiography, but this should serve as a foundation to help one understand some of the general uses.  Bones    As bones are easily visible on radiographs, X-rays are a great way to evaluate for bone pathology. The outer edge of long bones, called the cortex, is more dense than the inner portion, the medulla. Disruptions of the cortex, as occurs in fractures, are readily seen on x-ray.  This hand radiograph reveals an acute fracture of the 5th metacarpal (arrow). The smooth outer edge of the bone is disrupted at the site of the break. Note the bone distal to the break is angulated anteriorly. This is known as a \\"boxers\\" fracture, as the mechanism of injury is usually a punch, where the force is transmitted to the 5th metacarpal bone. Below is a magnified view of this fracture.    This radiograph of the right shoulder shows an acute fracture in a child.  The black arrows point to the fracture line. On the medial side, it is easy to see the disruption of the medial cortex of the bone.  The fracture line itself is more lucent than the adjacent bone, with the space between the bone fragments filled with blood and marrow, which are less dense than bone.  The clue that this is a child is the growth plate, which is a smooth, undulating lucent line separating the epiphysis from the metaphysis.  Disturbances in bone growth, including premature fusion of the growth plate, or abnormal widening of it, can be detected with radiographs. X-ray evaluation of the bony structures and growth plates of the hand are used to determine bone age.  In addition to fractures, radiography is an excellent way to look for focal lesions like tumors or infections that cause bone destruction. Other indications for use include evaluation of joint spaces for infection, arthritis, and dislocations.  Chest  Chest radiographs are one of the most common radiologic studies obtained.  They are excellent for evaluating the lungs, as normal lung appears black and most abnormalities, like infections, fluid collections and tumors, will appear varying shades of gray.  Can you see the lung mass on this CXR? lungmass  Masses are densely packed soft tissue, so they can be differentiated from the adjacent lucent normal lung quite well. Look below to see if you correctly identified the mass.  lungmasslabel  Chest radiography is also used to evaluate the size and shape of the heart and other mediastinal structures, and for detecting abnormalities of the pleura, such as a pleural effusion. A pleural effusion is an accumulation of fluid within the pleural space, between the parietal and visceral pleura. The fluid may be of a variety of compositions, including blood, pus and more simple fluid.  The radiograph shows a right pleural effusion. Fluid is much denser than air, and the contrast between the normally aerated, radiolucent lung and the denser fluid is sharp. Most of the right side of the chest is filled with fluid. A meniscus is seen along the lateral chest wall, as indicated by the arrow.  R-pleural-eff  Abdomen  Radiography is commonly used to evaluate the intestines (small and large bowel). The stomach and intestines contain both air and fluid. The radiolucent air makes the intestines visible on radiography.  This radiograph shows a small amount of air in the small bowel, and a bit more air is visible within the colon and rectum. If the intestines are abnormally dilated, as occurs in a bowel obstruction, this is easily identified on a radiograph.  Kidney stones, which contain calcium, are also readily evident on abdominal radiography as dense foci.    It is more difficult to identify the solid organs of the abdomen and pelvis, since they are all of similar soft tissue density. The edges of these organs can be seen only if they are separated by tissue of differing composition, for example fat.    In the radiograph above, the inferior edge of the liver and kidney are visible because of the contrast with the fat adjacent to them, which is more radiolucent and looks blacker on the film. In this patient, there is also a small amount of air in the stomach. Try to find these areas on the radiograph above and then check you answers below.    Dense structures, such as calcifications and metal, are easily seen on radiographs. This patient swallowed a pin, which can be faintly seen overlying the sacrum in the midline.

However, structures that are adjacent to the radiolucent lungs (less dense) can be visualized due to the difference in density.    CT: Axial Superior Mediastinum  This is a series of axial (transverse) CT images of the thorax of one patient. The images have been \\"windowed\\" (contrast adjusted) in order to highlight soft-tissue structures, and consequently, the lungs appear mostly black. As you work through these images, it may be helpful to remember the structures in the previous \\"slice\\" in order to be able to trace those structures and maintain orientation. This first image will ask you to name several structures for reference, most of which will continue to be present in subsequent slices. In all of these images, vascular structures are bright due to the injection of contrast dye in the venous system (usually via the arm) of the patient. You can assume that black represents air.

By performing the film PA, the heart is placed close to the detector plate, preventing magnification of the heart.    Cardiomegaly  This is a comparison of a normal-sized heart (right image) with an enlarged heart (left image). Notice that the enlarged heart is more globular in shape. The left heart borders is closer to the left lateral chest wall, and the right heart border extends out farther from the spine compared to the normal heart.  cardiomegaly  Lateral Chest Radiograph  In this view, the anterior and posterior heart borders are visible. There is some superimposition of the heart chambers on this view. The most posterior chamber is the left atrium, and the most anterior chamber is the right ventricle.    CT Heart  This is an axial CT image of the heart. Below are a reference PA chest radiograph and a comparable anatomic image from the Visible man showing the approximate level of this axial slice. As in all axial (transverse) images, the patient is lying supine and you are observing from the patient\'s feet looking towards the head.  An iodine based CT contrast agent was injected intravenously to opacify (increase the density of) the heart chambers and blood vessels.      Coronal CT  This image is of the same patient as in the previous image. CT images are obtained as a helix of data that can then be reformatted into imaging planes. This is a coronal reformated image of the contrast enhanced chest CT.    Cardiac Chambers  The borders of each cardiac chamber are not discernable on radiography (except where they are border forming with the lung, like the lateral margin of the right atrium).

Imaging the Heart Video  Linked below is a 10 minute introduction into imaging the heart recorded by Nancy McNulty, MD (Professor of Radioloy and Medical Education) that is intented to supplement the material covered in class.    Imaging the Heart Video (Open in New Tab)  Angiography  Aortic Arch Angiogram  An aortic arch angiogram is obtained by threading a catheter into the ascending aorta and injecting iodine-based dye. Sequential X-rays are then taken as the dye is injected. This image is a static image from the angiogram series.    Left Coronoary Angiogram    An angiogram of the coronary arteries is performed by threading a small catheter from the femoral artery in the groin up into the aorta, and selectively cannulating the coronary ostia. Radio-opaque dye is then injected and X-ray images are obtained via fluoroscopy to evaluate the coronary anatomy. Fluoroscopy allows for real-time acquisition of images, and is a technique which is conceptually similar to the standard X-ray radiographs which you have seen thus far. A major difference is that radio-dense material appears dark rather than bright. This image of the left coronary system is obtained via a right anterior oblique view of the heart.    Right Coronary Angiogram  This image was obtained via a left anterior oblique view (almost as thought you were looking \\"down the barrel\\" of the heart) in order to view the right coronary artery as it courses along the outside of the atrioventricular groove on the right. Because of the angle, the posterior interventricular artery branch will look significantly foreshortened.    Left Ventriculogram  This image is obtained by threading the catheter into the left ventricle and injecting contrast dye. The dynamic ejection of blood into the aorta can then be evaluated.

The sound waves are directed into the body and are reflected back to the ultrasound transducer. The reflected sound waves provide information about the depth, type of tissue, and tissue interfaces. This information is converted into grayscale images.  Unlike radiography, fluoroscopy and CT, ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation, so is low risk to the patient. It is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and allows one to perform \\"real-time\\" or \\"live\\" imaging and to observe motion.  How Images Are Obtained  An ultrasound transducer (shown below) is placed onto the patients skin with the gray area in full contact with the skin. Gel is used between the skin and transducer to prevent air from intervening between the two. The transducer emits a narrow beam of sound waves of a specific high frequency. Depending on the frequency, the sound waves penetrate the patient\'s tissues to a variable depth and are refracted, scattered, absorbed or reflected. The reflected waves (called an echo) bounce from tissues back to the transducer, which also acts as a sensor, or detector, and are used to generate the image.  US-transducer  High frequency sound waves provide high resolution images, but don\'t penetrate deeply into tissues, so are best for superficial structures. Lower frequency sound waves are used to image deeper structures, but create lower resolution images.  Sound waves are reflected at the interfaces of tissues with different acoustic impedance (a product of the density of the tissue and the velocity of sound in the medium). The intensity of the reflected US beam depends upon the different characteristics of adjacent tissues and tissue interfaces. Larger differences in tissue types yields higher intensity of the reflected sound. High intensity echos appear white on the US image, \\"echogenic or hyperechoic\\". Low intensity echos appear dark, or \\"hypoechoic\\".  An US scanner is shown below. As the transducer is moved over the patient, the screen displays the image in real-time. Since the transducer can be held in any position, images in the axial, sagittal, coronal planes, as well as any obliquity can be generated.  US-machine  Factors Affecting the Appearance  Composition of the Tissue  Solid organs, like the liver, have many internal tissue interfaces such as the bile ducts, portal vein branches, hepatic artery branches, hepatic veins, peri-portal fat, etc. This results in multiple reflected echos of variable intensity, and so the liver looks a medium shade of gray on US. Organs are slightly different from each other in their shade of gray on ultrasound based on differences in their tissue composition.  Fluid filled structures (gallbladder or urinary bladder) have no internal tissue interfaces and therefore do not reflect sound waves. As a result, the fluid filled portion of the structure will appear black and the walls gray to white. The US image of the gallbladder below illustrates this.  liverGB  Composition of Adjacent Tissues  The greater the differences between two adjacent structures, the greater the reflected sound waves and the more echogenic (white) the border between the tissues appears on the image. The difference in acoustic impedance between bone or air and adjacent tissues is large, and thus at such an interface most of the sound waves are reflected. Very few sound waves are left to penetrate and reach deeper structures. As a result ultrasound can\'t be used to image the area deep to bone or air, and since no echos are reflected from these locations, they look black on the US image.  The image below is a superficial ultrasound of the chest wall. The ribs, seen in cross section, are marked with stars. Note the anterior edges of the ribs are echogenic, and the black \\"shadow\\" posterior to the ribs, where no sound has been transmitted. The lung edge, running just posterior to the ribs, is also echogenic, but the lung parenchyma can\'t be imaged and appears black  ribsUS  Anatomical Structures  The solid organs of the abdomen, including the liver, kidneys and spleen, can be evlauated well with US. Deeper structures can\'t be seen with the same level of resolution as superficial structures because of the number of scattered, absorbed and reflected sound waves occuring, leaving less sound available to penetrate deeper tissues and reflect back to the transducer. As an example of this, look at the difference in resolution of the upper vs the lower pole of the right kidney, shown below. The lower pole, on the right side of the image, is more superifical and is seen with better resolution than the upper pole.  liverkid  Superficial structures (like the thyroid and testicles) can also be evaluated with ultrasound, with production of high resolution images. The image below is of a testicle. The black (anechoic) structure posterior to it (*) is an abnormal collection of fluid around the testicle, called a hydrocele.  testicle  US is widely used in obstetrics (OB), as the fluid in the amniotic sac provides a great \\"acoustic window\\" through which to image the fetus. The two images below are an US of a 19 week old fetus. The amniotic fluid is black (anechoic). The top part of the images shows the medium gray of the uterine wall and abdominal wall. Just deep to this is the black amniotic fluid, and then the fetus. The left image is a sagittal image of the fetus. The right image shows the fetus\'s hand in the center of the image.    Fluid or blood filled structures, for example the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and the heart, can be evaluated well with US. Depending on their location and depending on the composition of adjacent tissues, some blood vessels are seen well. For example, the descending thoracic aorta cannot be seen with ultrasound, due to its location deep to bone and air.  Indications for US  Pregnancy  US is used in early pregnancy to confirm the presence of an embryo. In mid pregnancy, a \\"screening\\" ultrasound is performed to evaluate for fetal anomalies. The brain, heart, stomach, kidneys, umbilical cord and other structures are carefully evaluated to determine if they are morphologically normal.  The image on the right shows the fetal head in the axial plane. The outer skull is not yet ossified, which is why we are able to US \\"through\\" it. The stars depict the right and left cerebellar hemispheres. The + symbols are located on the thalamus. Identifying these normal structures and confirming their normal size helps to exclude major congenital anomalies.  OBhead  Gynecology    Beautiful images of the uterus and ovaries are generated when US is performed with a transvaginal transducer (shown on bottom left). It is inserted into the vagina and positioned in the vaginal fornix. This places the transducer right next to the uterus and close to the ovaries, enabling high resolution images to be obtained.  In the image to the right, the vaginal wall is depicted by the green dots. The transducer sits against the wall and you can see its proximity to the uterus. The image on the bottom-right is a normal ovary, with the stars depicting follicles.    Abdominal Organs  The liver, kidneys, and spleen are routinely evaluated by ultrasound. Cysts, tumors, kidney stones and gallbladder calculi are some of the findings which can be seen with ultrasound. The below image on the left is a transverse US of the epigastrium. The body of the pancreas is clearly depicted (marked with the stars), which is unusual because gas within the stomach, lying anterior to the pancreas, often obscures it from being imaged.  It is easy to distinguish blood vessels from parenchyma. The image on the right is a transverse US of the upper liver. This shows the confluence of the right, middle, and left hepatic veins which are marked with stars.    Specialized Technology  Color & Spectral Doppler Ultrasound  Blood vessels can be identified with grayscale ultrasound, as shown above. Doppler ultrasound is used to gain additional information about the blood vessels and the blood flow through them. It is used to measure the velocity and direction of blood flow, to evaluate for stenosis (narrowing) of blood vessels, and for vascular resistance and patency.  Doppler US relies on the doppler effect; the change in frequency of sound waves reflected by a moving object. Blood moving towards the US transducer appears to have a higher frequency and shorter wavelength, while that moving away from the transducer appears to have a lower frequency and longer wavelength.  The image on the left is a color (power) doppler image showing blood flow in the common, internal and external carotid arteries.  The image on the right is a spectral doppler image of the internal carotid artery. Spectral doppler provides information on direction of blood flow and flow velocity (in cm/second).

The standardization of views facilitates the differentiation of normal versus abnormal patterns. In the case of radiographs of the shoulder, the standard views are:    Two AP shoulder films are taken to improve visibility of components of the head of the humerus (the greater and lesser tubercles). The Y-view is used to evaluate traumatic dislocation. Axillary views, though less frequently needed, may be required to diagnose shoulder dislocations, which can appear normal on AP films. Also shown in this module is an image demonstrating the acromioclavicular joints (i.e. the acromioclavicular view). This type of film is often used to evaluate shoulder separation.  AP Shoulder, external rotation  This view is taken with the patient in anatomical position (i.e. arm in external rotation).    AP shoulder, internal rotation  This view is taken with the arm internally rotated to demonstrate the profile of the lesser tubercle. The greater tubercle is displaced anteriorly and cannot be seen well (compared to the previous view).    Y View of Shoulder (transthoracic)  The Y-view is taken by aligning the x-ray beams parallel to the plane of the scapula so that it can be seen \\"floating\\" over the thoracic wall. In a healthy patient, the humeral head should be in alignment with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. If the glenoid cavity is not visualized directly, its position may be inferred from the intersection of the spine of the scapula, coracoid process and scapular body (the \\"Y\\" formation). Following a traumatic dislocation, the humeral head will not be aligned with the \\"Y\\".    Axillary view of shoulder  The axillary view is useful for detecting anterior or posterior shoulder dislocations that are not evident in the AP view. The x-ray beam is directed into the axilla from below (inferior to superior), or down through the axilla from above the shoulder (superior to inferior). Notice in this image how you can evaluate the alignment of the humeral head with the glenoid cavity (in this film they are aligned - there is no dislocation).    Acromioclavicular joints  The patient stands in the anatomical position and an AP film is taken that includes both acromioclavicular joints in the same image. This allows comparison of the two joints. Occasionally, a second film is taken while the patient holds weights in both arms. This is the \\"stress view\\" that helps elucidate acromioclavicular joint separation by increasing the load that the joint has to bear. If there is ligamentous injury, the joint space will widen.  The two spaces requiring careful evaluation are the acromioclavicular joint space and the coracoclavicular space. These should be symmetric on the right and left and should not be abnormally widened. Increased distances across the spaces indicate a degree of joint separation or sprain. The film here was taken of a college football player who suffered an AC separation on the right side. Note the widening compared to the left side.  acjoints  MRI: Axial Shoulder Arthrogram  This image is a T1-weighted MRI with contrast injected into the joint space of the right shoulder (arthrogram). The contrast material appears bright white. Fat usually appears bright in a T1-weighted image; however, a technique called \'fat saturation\' has been employed in this image to make the fat in the tissues and bone marrow dark in order not to detract from the brightness seen in the joint space.  MRI: Coronal shoulder arthrogram  This MRI represents a similar protocol to the axial series with contrast in the joint space and fat saturation, but shows a coronal image of the right shoulder.  } caption=\\"Coronal T1-weighted Shoulder Arthrogram\\" structures={[ \\"acromion\\", \\"coracoid process\\", \\"glenoid cavity\\", \\"axillary recess of the glenohumeral joint\\", ]} />   Shoulder Questions  Radiology Quiz    Osteology Quiz    Anatomy Quiz    Axilla & Brachial Plexus  Identify the roots, trunks, divisions, and cords on this diagram of the brachial plexus  Axilla & Brachial Plexus Questions  Anatomy Quiz    Arm & Elbow  Anteroposterior (AP) elbow  This view is taken with the patient in anatomical position.

Forearm Practice Questions  Radiology Quiz    Osteology Quize    Anatomy Quiz    Hand & Wrist  Imaging the Wrist and Hand  Patients are positioned for wrist and hand radiographs according to standardized protocols, so that normal patterns can be discerned and abnormalities can be readily identified.  The three standard views of the wrist and hand are:  Supplemental views include:  PA with the wrist in ulnar deviation - for closer examination of the scaphoid  Anteroposterior view with the hand in 45\xb0 oblique position (also called the ball catcher view) - useful in early arthritis  It is extremely important to remember that multiple views of a given area may be required to figure out what the actual three-dimensional relationships are.  PA Hand  The PA (posteroanterior) view is obtained in any radiologic examination of the hand and wrist. Since the human thumb is \\"rotated\\" 90\xb0 with respect to the fingers, this radiograph gives an oblique view of the thumb, but a PA view of all other structures.  PA Oblique Hand  In the PA oblique view, the patient holds the hand at about 45\xb0 with respect to the cassette, and fans the fingers so that they are well separated in the final radiograph.  In both the PA and PA oblique views, the scaphoid bone is not well isolated from the other carpal bones; it is superimposed on them. Scaphoid fractures are fairly common, so if there is concern about a possible scaphoid fracture, a different view is needed. What wrist position would move the carpal bones away from the scaphoid? (answer will be revealed soon...)    Lateral Hand  This is the third of the standard views of the wrist and hand. You can see that it is difficult to discern the individual carpal bones, however this view might be necessary to rule out a possible fracture.    Scaphoid   This is a radiograph of the wrist with the hand in ulnar deviation (adduction). This \\"opens up\\" the scaphoid bone and decreases the amount of overlap with adjacent carpal bones. This view is very useful in evaluating for scaphoid bone fractures.  Boxer\'s Fracture  A boxer\'s fracture typically involves the neck of the 5th metacarpal bone. In addition to any deformity seen from the angulation of the fracture, loss of the prominence of this \\"knuckle\\" when making a fist may be seen with this fracture.   MRI Axial Wrist  The following labled images show T2-weighted axial MRIs of the wrist. Image 1 is the most proximal and image 3 the most distal. The first image was taken at the distal forearm. Remember that by convention, cross sectional images are viewed as though you were standing at the foot of a supine patient, looking up towards their head. The top of the image is anterior and the bottom, posterior.  Connective tissue elements, such as tendons and ligaments will appear black in these images.  MRI: Coronal Wrist  This MRI sequence was obtained in the coronal plane, and demonstrates detail of the carpal bones.

Any evaluation of the upper extremity arteries must include an evaluation of the aortic arch and the brachiocephalic trunk. The aortic arch can be seen, with its three branches: the brachiocephalic trunk, the left common carotid and the left subclavian arteries. The brachiocephalic trunk divides into the right common carotid and the right subclavian arteries. The subclavian artery give off several branches, including the vertebral arteries. The subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery at the lateral border of the first rib.  Axillary and Brachial Angiogram  These are two images of the axillary and brachial arteries. The image on the left is taken earlier, and that on the right, later. The contrast was injected via a catheter which was placed into the subclavian artery/axillary artery junction. Notice that on the later image, the axillary artery isn\'t as visible, as unopacified blood flows into the axillary artery and mixes with and dilutes the x-ray dye.   Radial and Ulnar Angiograms  This is an angiogram of the arteries of the forearm. The contrast was injected via a catheter in the axillary artery/subclavian artery junction. The bolus of contrast is observed under flouroscopy and sequential images of the arm are taken to see the various arteries of the arm. Note that the common, anterior and posterior interosseous arteries are not visualized. They are either not present or are diminutive. Normal arterial anatomic variants such as this exist.    Arteries of the Hand   This image was taken when the bolus of contrast had reached the arteries in the hand. There are many anatomic variants in the arterial supply of the hand. In this patient, the deep palmar arch, which is predominantly formed and supplied by the radial artery, is well seen. The superficial palmar arch, which is predominantly formed and supplied by the ulnar artery, is absent. This is a normal variant.

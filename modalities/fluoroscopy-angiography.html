border-dmGreen-100">Introduction</h2>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Fluoroscopy is a specialized x-ray technique which images moving structures and displays them in real time on a television monitor. Fluoroscopic images look just like x-ray images, as they are obtained with a similar technique.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The benefit of fluoroscopy is the ability to visualize dynamic processes as they are occurring; think of fluoroscopy as a live x-ray movie. The downside of fluoroscopy, which is important to keep in mind, is the relatively high radiation dose to the patient.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Angiography is the use of fluoroscopy to place catheters and other interventional devices into blood vessels and image blood flow in vessels.</p>
<h2 id="how-images-are-obtained" class="clear-both text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 pb-2 leading-snug border-b-2 border-dmGreen-100">How Images Are Obtained</h2>
<h3 id="fluoroscopy-unit" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 leading-snug clear-both">Fluoroscopy Unit</h3>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The patient lies on a specialized table between the x-ray generator and the detector. The generator produces an x-ray beam which travels through the patient towards a specialized detector called the image intensifier.</p>
<figure class="w-60 bg-transparent md:m-4 mx-auto  md:float-right"><img class="w-full object-cover rounded-tl-lg rounded-tr-lg rounded-br-lg rounded-bl-lg" src="https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/angio/images/angio-unit.jpg" alt="fluoroscopy-unit"/></figure>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The image intensifier absorbs the transmitted x-rays and emits part of the absorbed energy as light photons. Through a sophisticated process, the number of light photons emitted is amplified and they are converted into a digital image. This is then displayed live on a tv monitor.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The physician observes the images on the monitor live, as the study is being performed.</p>
<h3 id="angiography" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 leading-snug clear-both">Angiography</h3>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Angiography is a general term describing the imaging of blood vessels with x-ray dye. Arteriograms refer to imaging of arteries, while venograms refer to imaging of veins.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Angiograms are obtained by injecting radioopaque contrast material (x-ray dye-just like that used in CT) into a blood vessel. The contrast mixes with the blood in the vessel, and is propelled forward by cardiac action (arteriograms) or towards the heart with venous return (venograms). The flow of the blood/contrast mixture can be observed fluoroscopically, or a sequence of static x-ray images can be obtained.</p>
<figure class="bg-transparent"><iframe src="https://dartmouth.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=ea34c392-4911-485e-9c5b-acb00151a689&amp;autoplay=false&amp;offerviewer=true&amp;showtitle=false&amp;showbrand=false&amp;start=0&amp;interactivity=all" class="rounded-lg drop-shadow-lg w-8/12 h-72 mx-auto"></iframe></figure>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Fluoroscopy is used to guide the placement and the positioning of the catheter into the blood vessel which is being studied.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The movie on the right is an arteriogram of the lower extremities. The catheter enters the right common femoral artery (catheter appears as a faint black line going across the right femur). The tip of the catheter is in the aorta, and this is where the contrast has been injected.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">It is important to understand these concepts when looking at angiograms:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
<li class="py-2">It is the vessel lumen that is being opacified - the vessel wall is not seen.</li>
<li class="py-2">The images can be displayed with the opacified blood vessels appearing white or black.</li>
<li class="py-2">You must look at the entire sequence of films, not just one film, in order to interpret angiograms optimally.</li>
<li class="py-2">The degree of radioopacity produced by a contrast injection will depend on the relative proportions of blood and contrast. As more (unopacified) blood mixes in with the contrast bolus, the vessel lumen will become fainter.</li>
<li class="py-2">If the heart is not pumping forcefully, and/or if the flow of blood is slow through a region (e.g. the main artery supplying the region is obstructed), the bolus of contrast will move comparatively slowly through the arterial tree.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="factors-affecting-the-appearance" class="clear-both text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 pb-2 leading-snug border-b-2 border-dmGreen-100">Factors Affecting the Appearance</h2>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">As fluoroscopy images are live images using x-rays, the same factors which affect the appearance of radiographs will influence the fluoroscopic image, such as density, thickness and shape. Click here if you need to review these factors.
The main difference in the appearance of radiographs vs. fluoroscopic images is in the use of contrast. Contrast agents are almost always used to highlight areas of interest and improve the diagnostic yield of the study.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Contrast agents can be placed in many different cavities of the body to allow them to be seen, including blood vessels, GI tract, biliary system, CNS, joints, uterus, and the urinary tract. What contrast agent is used will affect the appearance as well.</p>
<h3 id="display" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 leading-snug clear-both">Display</h3>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Importantly, fluoroscopic images are digital images which can be displayed such that dense structures appear white, like radiographs, or the images can be inverted such that dense structures appear black.</p>

<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The first image shows barium which has been swallowed and is traveling down the esophagus into the stomach. Barium is very dense, absorbing much of the incident x-ray beam and so appears white on the film. Without the barium, the stomach and esophagus wouldn&#x27;t be visible on an x-ray. Barium coats the mucosa and fills the lumen. Note the lungs appear dark and the ribs white, just like on an X-ray.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The second image is from a barium enema. Through a rectal catheter, barium is instilled into the rectum and flows retrograde into the colon. Its movement is observed fluoroscopically to ensure that the entire colon is coated and evaluated. Air is also instilled into the colon to distend it so that all of the walls are seen. This is called a &quot;double contrast barium enema&quot;. In this image, the patient has been rolled so that they are lying on their right side. (Note the air-barium level, with the barium located dependently). The flow of barium is observed fluoroscopically as the patient is moved. Barium coats the mucosa of the colon to make it visible on x-rays.</p>
<h2 id="intraarterial-and-intravenous-contrast" class="clear-both text-3xl mt-12 mb-4 pb-2 leading-snug border-b-2 border-dmGreen-100">Intraarterial and Intravenous Contrast</h2>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Angiograms (arteriograms and venograms) are obtained by injecting radioopaque contrast directly into a blood vessel via a needle or catheter. The contrast is iodine, which mixes with the blood and attenuates the x-ray beam, making the lumen of the blood vessel high density. The iodine is subsequently filtered through the kidneys and excreted in the urine.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The forward movement of the contrast bolus that occurs concurrent with venous return (venogram) or arterial flow (arteriogram) is observed fluoroscopically. Without the injected x-ray dye, the blood vessels would not be visible.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Angiograms are displayed digitally, and can be manipulated to show the vessel lumen as white or black. The movie below, of an abdominal aortic angiogram, is &quot;subtracted&quot; which means that the bones and other radiodense structures have been subtracted from the image so that only the opacified blood vessels are visible.</p>

<h4>Arthrography</h4>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Under fluoroscopic guidance, a needle can be placed into a joint, and iodinated contrast can be injected while watching fluoroscopically to better define and outline a joint space or bursa. This is called arthrography. Without the contrast, the joint space or bursa is not visible.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">After the joint has been injected, it is put through its range of motion to allow for complete filling of the joint space, as well as to assess the capsule, look for fragments or loose bodies in the joint space, and assess the cartilage and underlying bone.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Images from a left shoulder arthrogram are displayed. Dense structures, like bone, appear dark. The injected contrast is dark. Note the size of the joint space, and how far inferiorly it extends. The lower image shows the thickness of the articular cartilage. The white arrows indicate contrast in the joint space and the lucency between this contrast and the bone is the articular cartilage.</p>

<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Fluoroscopy is used to evaluate dynamic processes and structures in motion. It is used both in the diagnosis and in the treatment of disease. Diagnostic uses include evaluation of swallowing function, study of the gastrointestinal tract, motion of the diaphragm and motion of joints, evaluation of blood vessel patency and size. Therapeutically, it is used in everyday practice as guidance for a wide variety of interventional procedures, performed by radiologists and other specialists.</p>
<h3 id="gastrointestinal-tract" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 leading-snug clear-both">Gastrointestinal Tract</h3>

Fluoroscopic images look just like x-ray images, as they are obtained with a similar technique.\n\nThe benefit of fluoroscopy is the ability to visualize dynamic processes as they are occurring; think of fluoroscopy as a live x-ray movie. The downside of fluoroscopy, which is important to keep in mind, is the relatively high radiation dose to the patient.\n\nAngiography is the use of fluoroscopy to place catheters and other interventional devices into blood vessels and image blood flow in vessels.\n\n## How Images Are Obtained\n\n### Fluoroscopy Unit\n\nThe patient lies on a specialized table between the x-ray generator and the detector. The generator produces an x-ray beam which travels through the patient towards a specialized detector called the image intensifier.\n\n\u003cImage\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/angio/images/angio-unit.jpg\"\n  alt=\"fluoroscopy-unit\"\n  wrap=\"right\"\n  size=\"md\"\n/\u003e\n\nThe image intensifier absorbs the transmitted x-rays and emits part of the absorbed energy as light photons. Through a sophisticated process, the number of light photons emitted is amplified and they are converted into a digital image. This is then displayed live on a tv monitor.\n\nThe physician observes the images on the monitor live, as the study is being performed.\n\n### Angiography\n\nAngiography is a general term describing the imaging of blood vessels with x-ray dye. Arteriograms refer to imaging of arteries, while venograms refer to imaging of veins.\n\nAngiograms are obtained by injecting radioopaque contrast material (x-ray dye-just like that used in CT) into a blood vessel. The contrast mixes with the blood in the vessel, and is propelled forward by cardiac action (arteriograms) or towards the heart with venous return (venograms). The flow of the blood/contrast mixture can be observed fluoroscopically, or a sequence of static x-ray images can be obtained.\n\n\u003cVideo\n  src=\"https://dartmouth.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=ea34c392-4911-485e-9c5b-acb00151a689\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=false\u0026showbrand=false\u0026start=0\u0026interactivity=all\"\n/\u003e\n\nFluoroscopy is used to guide the placement and the positioning of the catheter into the blood vessel which is being studied.\n\nThe movie on the right is an arteriogram of the lower extremities. The catheter enters the right common femoral artery (catheter appears as a faint black line going across the right femur). The tip of the catheter is in the aorta, and this is where the contrast has been injected.\n\nIt is important to understand these concepts when looking at angiograms:\n\n1. It is the vessel lumen that is being opacified - the vessel wall is not seen.\n2. The images can be displayed with the opacified blood vessels appearing white or black.\n3. You must look at the entire sequence of films, not just one film, in order to interpret angiograms optimally.\n4. The degree of radioopacity produced by a contrast injection will depend on the relative proportions of blood and contrast. As more (unopacified) blood mixes in with the contrast bolus, the vessel lumen will become fainter.\n5. If the heart is not pumping forcefully, and/or if the flow of blood is slow through a region (e.g. the main artery supplying the region is obstructed), the bolus of contrast will move comparatively slowly through the arterial tree.\n\n## Factors Affecting the Appearance\n\nAs fluoroscopy images are live images using x-rays, the same factors which affect the appearance of radiographs will influence the fluoroscopic image, such as density, thickness and shape. Click here if you need to review these factors.\nThe main difference in the appearance of radiographs vs. fluoroscopic images is in the use of contrast. Contrast agents are almost always used to highlight areas of interest and improve the diagnostic yield of the study.\n\nContrast agents can be placed in many different cavities of the body to allow them to be seen, including blood vessels, GI tract, biliary system, CNS, joints, uterus, and the urinary tract. What contrast agent is used will affect the appearance as well.\n\n### Display\n\nImportantly, fluoroscopic images are digital images which can be displayed such that dense structures appear white, like radiographs, or the images can be inverted such that dense structures appear black.\n\n### Intraluminal Contrast Agent: Barium\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cImageSlider\u003e\n\u003cImage\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/angio/images/esophagram.gif\"\n  alt=\"espohagram\"\n  wrap=\"center\"\n  size=\"lg\"\n  caption=\"Barium Esophagram\"\n/\u003e\n\u003cImage\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/angio/images/be-rlat.gif\"\n  alt=\"be-rlat\"\n  wrap=\"center\"\n  size=\"lg\"\n  caption=\"Barium Enema\"\n/\u003e\n\u003c/ImageSlider\u003e\n\nThe first image shows barium which has been swallowed and is traveling down the esophagus into the stomach. Barium is very dense, absorbing much of the incident x-ray beam and so appears white on the film. Without the barium, the stomach and esophagus wouldn't be visible on an x-ray. Barium coats the mucosa and fills the lumen. Note the lungs appear dark and the ribs white, just like on an X-ray.\n\nThe second image is from a barium enema. Through a rectal catheter, barium is instilled into the rectum and flows retrograde into the colon. Its movement is observed fluoroscopically to ensure that the entire colon is coated and evaluated. Air is also instilled into the colon to distend it so that all of the walls are seen. This is called a \"double contrast barium enema\". In this image, the patient has been rolled so that they are lying on their right side. (Note the air-barium level, with the barium located dependently). The flow of barium is observed fluoroscopically as the patient is moved. Barium coats the mucosa of the colon to make it visible on x-rays.\n\n## Intraarterial and Intravenous Contrast\n\nAngiograms (arteriograms and venograms) are obtained by injecting radioopaque contrast directly into a blood vessel via a needle or catheter. The contrast is iodine, which mixes with the blood and attenuates the x-ray beam, making the lumen of the blood vessel high density. The iodine is subsequently filtered through the kidneys and excreted in the urine.\n\nThe forward movement of the contrast bolus that occurs concurrent with venous return (venogram) or arterial flow (arteriogram) is observed fluoroscopically. Without the injected x-ray dye, the blood vessels would not be visible.\n\nAngiograms are displayed digitally, and can be manipulated to show the vessel lumen as white or black. The movie below, of an abdominal aortic angiogram, is \"subtracted\" which means that the bones and other radiodense structures have been subtracted from the image so that only the opacified blood vessels are visible.\n\n\u003cVideo\n  src=\"https://dartmouth.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=da06f352-597f-4da5-949a-acb00151ab55\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=false\u0026showbrand=false\u0026start=0\u0026interactivity=all\"\n  caption=\"How Angiography is obtained.\"\n/\u003e\n\n### Intraarticular Contrast Agent: Iodine\n\n#### Arthrography\n\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance, a needle can be placed into a joint, and iodinated contrast can be injected while watching fluoroscopically to better define and outline a joint space or bursa. This is called arthrography. Without the contrast, the joint space or bursa is not visible.\n\nAfter the joint has been injected, it is put through its range of motion to allow for complete filling of the joint space, as well as to assess the capsule, look for fragments or loose bodies in the joint space, and assess the cartilage and underlying bone.\n\nImages from a left shoulder arthrogram are displayed. Dense structures, like bone, appear dark. The injected contrast is dark. Note the size of the joint space, and how far inferiorly it extends. The lower image shows the thickness of the articular cartilage. The white arrows indicate contrast in the joint space and the lucency between this contrast and the bone is the articular cartilage.\n\n\u003cImageRow\n  srcs={['https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/angio/images/shouldarthr.gif', 'https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/angio/images/shouldarthr2.gif']}\n  alts={['shouldarthr', 'shouldarthr2']}\n/\u003e\n\n## Indications for Use\n\nFluoroscopy is used to evaluate dynamic processes and structures in motion. It is used both in the diagnosis and in the treatment of disease. Diagnostic uses include evaluation of swallowing function, study of the gastrointestinal tract, motion of the diaphragm and motion of joints, evaluation of blood vessel patency and size. Therapeutically, it is used in everyday practice as guidance for a wide variety of interventional procedures, performed by radiologists and other specialists.\n\n### Gastrointestinal Tract\n\n\u003cImage\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/angio/images/indications1sbft.gif\"\n  alt=\"indications1sbft\"\n  wrap=\"right\"\n  size=\"lg\"\n/\u003e\n\nFluoroscopy is invaluable in the evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract.

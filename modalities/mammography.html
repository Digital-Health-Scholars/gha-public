<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">A mammogram is a low dose x-ray examination of the breast that is used to screen for breast cancer. Mammography has been proven to decrease deaths from breast cancer and mitigate suffering from breast cancer and breast cancer treatments. Screening mammography finds the majority of cancers before they are felt by the patient or provider. Screening mammography is able to depict breast cancer at an earlier stage – often before it has spread outside the breast.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Mammography is also used in the diagnostic setting to further characterize an abnormality found during screening or to evaluate a patient or provider’s concern about a physical examination sign or symptom. Breast ultrasound, MRI and image guided minimally invasive core biopsies are frequently performed to diagnose breast abnormalities.
Screening mammography is a standardized program with federal law (The Mammography Quality Standards Act) governing the equipment, procedures and personnel.  Outcome auditing is performed regularly to assess program quality.</p>

<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The mammographic unit is shown on the right. The breast is compressed between a plastic plate and the X-ray detector.  This compression improves the visibility of normal and abnormal structures within the breast, decreases x-ray dose and reduces patient motion during the exposure.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The gantry can rotate 360 degrees, depending on the view desired. In the position shown, it will take a cranio-caudal &quot;CC&quot; view.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Two standard views are obtained of each breast in a screening mammogram, the cranio-caudal &quot;CC&quot; view and the medio-lateral oblique view &quot;MLO&quot; view.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Cranio-Caudal View - the breast is compressed from top to bottom. The x-ray photons pass through the breast from the head to the feet and are registered at the detector below the breast.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Medial Lateral Oblique View - utilizing the obliquity of the pectoralis major as the axis for positioning the gantry holding the compression plate and detector, the breast is compressed obliquely, and the photons pass through the breast and are registered at the detector below. The green dot indicates the axillary tail of the breast.</p>

<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Different views and techniques can be done to problem solve. Some examples include:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
<li class="py-2"><strong>Magnification views</strong> – Increasing the distance from the breast to the receptor plate allows magnification and increased spatial resolution and thereby helps characterize the size and shape of calcium particles and margins of masses. The image on the left is a standard CC view and on the right a coned down, magnified view of the area of concern. The green circle highlights the mass. <figure class="w-60 bg-transparent md:m-4 mx-auto md:w-96 md:mx-auto"><img class="w-full object-cover rounded-tl-lg rounded-tr-lg rounded-br-lg rounded-bl-lg" src="https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/how%20images%20obtained/MagMass.jpg" alt="MagMass"/><figcaption class="p-1 my-2 prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full text-center italic text-sm">Magnification View of Suspicious Mass</figcaption></figure></li>
<li class="py-2"><strong>Lateral-medial (“LM”) view</strong> – The beam passes lateral to medial. This view helps depict a lesion in a true orthogonal view to facilitate directed ultrasound or core biopsy. It is also helpful in characterizing benign “milk of calcium” which layers when viewed from the side.</li>
<li class="py-2"><strong>Spot Compression</strong> – These views use a small paddle to provide focal additional compression, to improve conspicuity of a specific area of interest.</li>
<li class="py-2"><strong>Rolled View</strong> – The top of the breast is rolled relative to the bottom to spread out the tissues and provide information about the presence and location of findings seen only seen in one plane.</li>
<li class="py-2"><strong>Exaggerated Lateral Cranial-caudal view (<code>XCCL</code>)</strong> – Used to better evaluate lateral tissue in the cranio-caudal projection.</li>

<h3 id="breast-density" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 leading-snug clear-both">Breast Density</h3>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The composition of the breast affects the appearance of the image and the sensitivity of the study for detection of abnormal soft tissue densities. Radiologists are required to report the breast composition in their reports to alert the reader to the relative sensitivity of the study for detection of non-calcified cancers. There are four categories of breast density.</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
<li class="py-2"><strong>Fatty</strong></li>
<li class="py-2"><strong>Scattered</strong></li>
<li class="py-2"><strong>Heterogeneously dense</strong></li>

<h3 id="importance-of-breast-compression" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 leading-snug clear-both">Importance of breast compression</h3>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Compression of the breast between the plate and the detector spreads out the overlapping breast tissues. Degree of compression is measured in Lbs.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Compression helps to differentiate true masses from summation shadows that occur because of overlapping soft tissues. Compression renders the breast nearly uniform in thickness so the film density of tissues near the nipple will be similar to those near the chest wall. This also decreases the radiation dose to the breast.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Note that in this image, 33 Lbs of compression results in less overlap and improved conspicuity of the fibroglandular tissues compared with 17 Lbs.</p>

<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Breast cancer can have several different appearances on mammography. The next few images demonstrate the most common mammographic findings of breast cancer.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The most specific sign of malignancy on mammography is a lobulated (bumpy) spiculated mass. Spiculations describe the linear strands/spikes extending outward from the mass, like spokes on a wheel.</p>

<h3 id="digital-mammography" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 leading-snug clear-both">Digital Mammography</h3>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Until 2000 the detector was a piece of film in a cassette. This was known as “film screen” mammography. Among other disadvantages, film was a medium that could not be shared and could be lost or damaged.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">In 2000 the FDA approved “digital mammography” systems. The detector is no longer a piece of film, rather a photon receptor that converts the photons to a digital signal that can be viewed on a high resolution monitor instead of a lightbox. Digital mammography has largely replaced film based screening. As of 2015, 95% of all units in the United States are full field digital units.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">This image shows the differing conspicuity of breast tissue on film screen vs digital mammography.</p>

<h3 id="3d-tomosynthesis" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 leading-snug clear-both">3D Tomosynthesis</h3>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Also called “3-D Mammography”, 3D tomosynthesis acquires a variable number of images in an arc-like swing of the camera and recreates the information into a series of 1 mm slices, the number of slices depending on the thickness of the compressed breast.  This method reduces overlapping tissue superimposition, improving both sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">As of 2016, the technology has gained wide acceptance because of the ability to detect 40% more invasive cancers and avert 20% of recalls (recalls are additional images obtained to clarify otherwise normal structures). As of 2016 50% of sites had at least one 3-D tomosynthesis unit.</p>
<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">This image is a 1mm thick image from a tomosynthesis, showing an area of architectural distortion.</p>

<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">The images obtained with tomosynthesis can be viewed as a movie. Look for the area of architectural distortion as it comes into focus in the medial breast, about midway through the video.</p>

<p class="my-6 clear-none prose prose-invert prose-base max-w-full">Mammograms are considered one of the more difficult studies that radiologists interpret. Specific training is federally mandated to legally interpret mammograms for signs of cancer.</p>

Mammography has been proven to decrease deaths from breast cancer and mitigate suffering from breast cancer and breast cancer treatments. Screening mammography finds the majority of cancers before they are felt by the patient or provider. Screening mammography is able to depict breast cancer at an earlier stage – often before it has spread outside the breast.\n\nMammography is also used in the diagnostic setting to further characterize an abnormality found during screening or to evaluate a patient or provider’s concern about a physical examination sign or symptom. Breast ultrasound, MRI and image guided minimally invasive core biopsies are frequently performed to diagnose breast abnormalities.\nScreening mammography is a standardized program with federal law (The Mammography Quality Standards Act) governing the equipment, procedures and personnel.  Outcome auditing is performed regularly to assess program quality.\n\n## How Images Are Obtained\n\n\u003cImage\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/how%20images%20obtained/mammo-unit.jpg\"\n  alt=\"mammo-unit\"\n  wrap=\"right\"\n  size=\"sm\"\n/\u003e\n\nThe mammographic unit is shown on the right. The breast is compressed between a plastic plate and the X-ray detector.  This compression improves the visibility of normal and abnormal structures within the breast, decreases x-ray dose and reduces patient motion during the exposure.\n\nThe gantry can rotate 360 degrees, depending on the view desired. In the position shown, it will take a cranio-caudal \"CC\" view.\n\nTwo standard views are obtained of each breast in a screening mammogram, the cranio-caudal \"CC\" view and the medio-lateral oblique view \"MLO\" view.\n\nCranio-Caudal View - the breast is compressed from top to bottom. The x-ray photons pass through the breast from the head to the feet and are registered at the detector below the breast.\n\nMedial Lateral Oblique View - utilizing the obliquity of the pectoralis major as the axis for positioning the gantry holding the compression plate and detector, the breast is compressed obliquely, and the photons pass through the breast and are registered at the detector below. The green dot indicates the axillary tail of the breast.\n\n\u003cImageRow\n  srcs={['https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/how%20images%20obtained/CC-position.jpg', 'https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/how%20images%20obtained/MLO-position.jpg']}\n  alts={['cc-position', 'mlo-position']}\n  captions={['Cranio-caudal position', 'Medio-lateral oblique position']}\n/\u003e\n\n### Cranio-Caudal View\n\nThe x-ray photons pass through the breast from superior to inferior and are registered at the detector below the breast.\n\nThe images are viewed back to back to compare the fibroglandular tissue in each breast and optimize detection of asymmetries.\n\nBy convention the laterality markers (**RCC**, **LCC**) are always placed at the lateral aspect of the breast.\n\n\u003cImageOverlay\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/how%20images%20obtained/CC/MammoCC.jpg\"\n  map={\n    {\"name\":\"mammo-cc\",\"areas\":[\n      {\n        \"name\":\"medial-right\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[76,277,267,277,266,533,245,529,216,517,191,499,170,479,149,454,128,424,117,404,99,373,87,340,80,315,77,296],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Medial Right Breast\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\":\"medial-left\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[467,309,267,309,267,534,284,530,308,523,329,511,348,499,374,475,400,444,420,416,436,391,450,369,460,343,465,325],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Medial Left Breast\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\":\"lateral-right\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[267,277,76,277,77,267,80,252,86,231,94,212,109,186,125,163,143,143,160,125,183,104,197,93,214,79,228,68,241,58,257,50,268,45],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Lateral Right Breast\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\":\"lateral-left\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[267,309,467,309,467,299,465,292,466,278,464,261,460,245,453,225,444,204,432,182,417,158,404,136,393,119,380,100,369,86,359,71,351,61,343,52,331,44,313,32,295,21,281,14,268,8],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Lateral Left Breast\"\n      },\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  caption=\"Cranio-Caudal Views of the Right and Left Breasts\"\n  structures={[\n\"Medial breast\",\n\"Lateral breast\",\n]}\n/\u003e\n\n### Medial Lateral Oblique View\n\nUtilizing the obliquity of the pectoralis major as the axis for positioning the gantry holding the compression plate and detector, the breast is compressed obliquely, from axilla to the lower inner breast.

The image on the left is a standard CC view and on the right a coned down, magnified view of the area of concern. The green circle highlights the mass. \u003cImage\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/how%20images%20obtained/MagMass.jpg\"\n  alt=\"MagMass\"\n  caption=\"Magnification View of Suspicious Mass\"\n  wrap=\"center\"\n  size=\"lg\"\n/\u003e\n2. **Lateral-medial (“LM”) view** – The beam passes lateral to medial. This view helps depict a lesion in a true orthogonal view to facilitate directed ultrasound or core biopsy. It is also helpful in characterizing benign “milk of calcium” which layers when viewed from the side.\n3. **Spot Compression** – These views use a small paddle to provide focal additional compression, to improve conspicuity of a specific area of interest.\n4. **Rolled View** – The top of the breast is rolled relative to the bottom to spread out the tissues and provide information about the presence and location of findings seen only seen in one plane.\n5. **Exaggerated Lateral Cranial-caudal view (`XCCL`)** – Used to better evaluate lateral tissue in the cranio-caudal projection.\n6. **Cleavage View** – Optimizes inclusion of medial tissues in the cranio-caudal view through including\n\n## Factors Affecting Appearance\n\n### Breast Density\n\nThe composition of the breast affects the appearance of the image and the sensitivity of the study for detection of abnormal soft tissue densities. Radiologists are required to report the breast composition in their reports to alert the reader to the relative sensitivity of the study for detection of non-calcified cancers. There are four categories of breast density.\n\n1. **Fatty**\n2. **Scattered**\n3. **Heterogeneously dense**\n4. **Extremely dense**\n\nThe image below depicts the two extremes of breast composition.\n\n\u003cImageOverlay\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/Factors%20appear/density/Densityboth.jpg\"\n  map={\n    {\"name\":\"breast-density-extremes\",\"areas\":[\n      {\n        \"name\":\"fatty-breast\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[89,2,75,75,56,165,39,223,26,261,13,292,2,309,4,461,30,474,73,474,123,471,166,462,199,450,221,438,240,415,255,384,260,352,260,306,252,241,243,195,233,158,222,113,214,76,208,37,204,0],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Fatty Breast\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\":\"dense-breast\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[305,58,277,185,272,221,271,396,272,457,296,469,315,481,338,492,366,497,389,497,415,493,443,479,464,458,482,438,501,416,511,395,517,377,525,352,528,326,523,300,516,279,509,254,495,221,480,199,456,170,417,131,390,104,364,84,327,67],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Extremely Dense Breast\"\n      },\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  caption=\"Extremes of Breast Density\"\n  structures={[\"Fatty breast (Left)\", \"Extremely dense breast (Right)\"]}\n/\u003e\n\n### Importance of breast compression\nCompression of the breast between the plate and the detector spreads out the overlapping breast tissues. Degree of compression is measured in Lbs.\n\nCompression helps to differentiate true masses from summation shadows that occur because of overlapping soft tissues. Compression renders the breast nearly uniform in thickness so the film density of tissues near the nipple will be similar to those near the chest wall. This also decreases the radiation dose to the breast.\n\nNote that in this image, 33 Lbs of compression results in less overlap and improved conspicuity of the fibroglandular tissues compared with 17 Lbs.\n\n![CompressnBoth](https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/CompressnBoth.jpg)\n\n## What to look for\n\nThe normal features of the breast are scrutinized when interpreting a mammogram.

The next few images demonstrate the most common mammographic findings of breast cancer.\n\nThe most specific sign of malignancy on mammography is a lobulated (bumpy) spiculated mass. Spiculations describe the linear strands/spikes extending outward from the mass, like spokes on a wheel.\n\nThe green circle on this image highlights a spiculated mass that is highly suspicious for cancer. This is a magnified view taken after a suspicious area was identified on the screening mammogram.\n\n![spiculatedMass](https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/What%20we%20look%20for/spiculatedMass.jpg)\n\n### Architectural distortion\n\nArchitectural distortion is perceived as straightened lines or lines converging on a central point. This pattern is atypical for normal fibroglandular tissue, but is seen with breast carcinomas.\n\nThis image shows a standard and magnified view with the yellow box highlighting an area of architectural distortion.\n\n![ArchitecDistor](https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/What%20we%20look%20for/ArchitecDistor.jpg)\n\n### Microcalcifications\n\nCalcifications are fairly common within the breast and are usually benign, caused by things like arterial atherosclerosis and fat necrosis.\n\nSpecific patterns of microcalcifications can be seen with carcinomas, which can be detected on mammography. Pleomorphic (irregular shapes and sizes) groups (clusters) are a sign of cancer.\n\nThis magnified view demonstrates a cluster of irregularly shaped pleomorphic calcifications.\n\n![PleiomorphicCa](https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/What%20we%20look%20for/PleomorphicCa.jpg)\n\n## New Technology\n\n### Digital Mammography\n\nUntil 2000 the detector was a piece of film in a cassette. This was known as “film screen” mammography. Among other disadvantages, film was a medium that could not be shared and could be lost or damaged.\n\nIn 2000 the FDA approved “digital mammography” systems. The detector is no longer a piece of film, rather a photon receptor that converts the photons to a digital signal that can be viewed on a high resolution monitor instead of a lightbox. Digital mammography has largely replaced film based screening. As of 2015, 95% of all units in the United States are full field digital units.\n\nThis image shows the differing conspicuity of breast tissue on film screen vs digital mammography.\n\n![film_digital](https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/New%20technology/film_digital.jpg)\n\n### 3D Tomosynthesis\n\nAlso called “3-D Mammography”, 3D tomosynthesis acquires a variable number of images in an arc-like swing of the camera and recreates the information into a series of 1 mm slices, the number of slices depending on the thickness of the compressed breast.  This method reduces overlapping tissue superimposition, improving both sensitivity and specificity.\n\nAs of 2016, the technology has gained wide acceptance because of the ability to detect 40% more invasive cancers and avert 20% of recalls (recalls are additional images obtained to clarify otherwise normal structures). As of 2016 50% of sites had at least one 3-D tomosynthesis unit.\n\nThis image is a 1mm thick image from a tomosynthesis, showing an area of architectural distortion.\n\n![3Dpic](https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/New%20technology/3Dpic.jpg)\n\nThe images obtained with tomosynthesis can be viewed as a movie. Look for the area of architectural distortion as it comes into focus in the medial breast, about midway through the video.\n\n\u003cVideo\n  src=\"https://d2y36twrtb17ty.cloudfront.net/sessions/340592eb-f949-49ad-a7e8-acb00137bd50/bc84b23a-3e48-4291-90d9-acb00137bd50-de4493ee-29c5-4099-b3e4-acb00137bd50.mp4\"\n/\u003e\n\n## Interpretation\n\nMammograms are considered one of the more difficult studies that radiologists interpret. Specific training is federally mandated to legally interpret mammograms for signs of cancer.\n\nAll projections should be labeled stating the view and breast being displayed. The radiologist should assess if there is adequate penetration and compression of tissue.\n\n### Factors to assess\n\n1. Is there adequate tissue included?\n2. Is the pectoralis major included in MLO view?\n3. Is the nipple in profile?\n4. Is the retroglandular fat included?\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n-----------\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cImageOverlay\n  src=\"https://anatomy.host.dartmouth.edu/HAE/Radiology_Intro/Mammography/AnatomyMLO/AnatomyMLO.jpg\"\n  map={\n    {\"name\":\"mlo-anatomy-2\",\"areas\":[\n      {\n        \"name\":\"nipple\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[334,349,323,377,331,377,337,375,343,370,345,363,343,355],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Nipple\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\":\"retroglandular-fat\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[168,310,163,287,153,270,138,277,128,296,122,332,121,379,120,411,126,423,141,423,155,416,168,406,175,383,176,344],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Retroglandular Fat\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\":\"pectoralis-major-muscle\",\n        \"shape\":\"poly\",\n        \"coordinates\":[121,308,137,265,160,195,181,132,197,87,212,43,219,18,223,0,231,0,223,32,209,74,173,175,147,252,127,302],\n        \"tooltip\":\"Edge of Pectoralis Major\"\n      },\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  caption=\"Assessing for Adequate Tissue on MLO View\"\n/\u003e\n\n## Breast cancer\n\nWhen reading a mammogram, it’s best to have a search pattern to prevent misses.\nCompare one breast to the other, zone by zone.
